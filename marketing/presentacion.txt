1
00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:00.965
Okay, great.

2
00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:03.885
So this is a smaller group as I understand,

3
00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:08.965
but since it's a new, um, um, new module,

4
00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:10.845
let me introduce myself just in case.

5
00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.245
Some of you might know me, but others probably don't.

6
00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:17.845
So, um, ILE is my name.

7
00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:23.045
Um, I have, um, three hats.

8
00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:26.085
Um, classic marketing, traditional marketing,

9
00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.165
innovation and strategy.

10
00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:32.525
Um, I have, uh, couple of decades

11
00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:35.965
of marketing practice behind me.

12
00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:39.755
I initially started in the corporate world, um,

13
00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:44.835
at Unilever first, um, doing research

14
00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:48.635
and then doing classic brand management marketing.

15
00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:52.115
Then I switched jobs and went to advertising.

16
00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:54.845
I stayed there only a year.

17
00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:57.565
'cause I thought, okay, this is not exactly for me.

18
00:00:57.565 --> 00:00:59.125
I wanna go back to marketing.

19
00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:03.725
Um, I was at the Coca-Cola company for 14 years.

20
00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:07.805
Um, had various roles, regional head of marketing roles,

21
00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:09.885
like I was head of marketing for Cocos

22
00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:12.885
and Central Asian Republics head of marketing for,

23
00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:14.565
for Hungary, Czech, and Slovak.

24
00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:17.805
I was in Vienna doing projects for Eastern Europe.

25
00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.045
And then I was in Atlanta

26
00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:23.085
for eight years on the global marketing team, um,

27
00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:24.605
as global brand director,

28
00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:26.845
global innovation director, et cetera.

29
00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:31.165
Then I decided to come back home

30
00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:35.325
after 11 years of expatriation, uh, come back home

31
00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:38.285
to Istanbul, Turkey, and set up my own business.

32
00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:41.605
And I'm doing, uh, consulting, uh,

33
00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:43.925
global marketing consulting, um,

34
00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:48.125
on traditional brand building, but also innovation

35
00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:50.325
and strategy development.

36
00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:55.005
Okay. So I'm doing consulting. I'm doing, um, workshops.

37
00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:57.645
I'm doing a lot of teaching these days.

38
00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:01.925
Um, I'm doing mentoring, uh, the whole thing. Okay.

39
00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:07.125
And, um, so this is an exciting class or module for me

40
00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:11.355
because, um, I think marketing is

41
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:15.745
at the foundation of any business, you know?

42
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:19.945
Um, and I feel almost obliged

43
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:23.025
to teach about classic traditional marketing,

44
00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:26.465
because these days, the minute you hear the word marketing,

45
00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:30.105
people automatically think first about digital marketing,

46
00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:31.945
social media, marketing, and all of that.

47
00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.385
And although these are super important,

48
00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:40.755
what I would call tools, which when I started out first

49
00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:44.835
as a young person could, I could have only dreamed about,

50
00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:49.115
I still do believe that it's absolutely crucial

51
00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:54.115
to understand, um, the strategic aspect of marketing.

52
00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:58.235
Because if someone asked me, if you told me, like,

53
00:02:58.425 --> 00:03:01.005
give us a, in one word, literally one word,

54
00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:04.845
what marketing is, I would say marketing equals strategy.

55
00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:10.225
So in other words, you need to know why you are doing

56
00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:13.305
what you are doing to be able to be,

57
00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:15.705
um, efficient and effective.

58
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:19.825
And so I feel a little bit challenged

59
00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:23.065
by people thinking marketing equals digital marketing,

60
00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:24.745
because it is not,

61
00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:29.785
and I think it will be, you would be lacking an important

62
00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:34.825
foundation if you have treated, um,

63
00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:39.385
if you have lacked the strategic aspect of marketing

64
00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.785
and just went direct to digital marketing.

65
00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:46.545
Okay? So in this course, um,

66
00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:49.345
my aim is to give you the foundations of marketing.

67
00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:54.825
I understand that the majority of the class, um, consists

68
00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:57.745
of business people like c-level people

69
00:03:57.885 --> 00:04:00.385
or directors, non marketeers.

70
00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:03.545
So that's music to my ears, um,

71
00:04:03.655 --> 00:04:06.225
because I believe it's absolutely critical

72
00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:07.705
to understand what marketing is.

73
00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:11.795
So if you're working for a company

74
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:17.995
with billion dollar brands, or if you are a solopreneur

75
00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:23.075
or a startup, um, I hope you would benefit from this class,

76
00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:25.635
um, because marketing is for everyone.

77
00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:28.115
And the challenge is if you're a small company,

78
00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:33.555
you wouldn't have the right resources, uh, to hire the,

79
00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:37.845
you know, the required resources to hire, um,

80
00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:43.215
marketeers, maybe, you know, few marketeers.

81
00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:48.295
So by definition, I find that business people then need

82
00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:52.215
to learn about marketing in order to sort of

83
00:04:53.235 --> 00:04:56.965
make qualified and relevant decisions for their businesses.

84
00:04:57.435 --> 00:05:01.845
Okay, without further ado. So let's start.

85
00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:05.005
And one thing, uh, the q and a is usually fun.

86
00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:06.405
I enjoy that part very much,

87
00:05:06.465 --> 00:05:09.965
and I usually get great questions, so I encourage you

88
00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:11.165
to ask me questions.

89
00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:15.125
Um, the only thing that I avoid is, uh, you know,

90
00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:18.805
some people loves to ask naturally, uh,

91
00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.925
specific questions about their businesses.

92
00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:23.045
You know, very specific, sort of,

93
00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.005
how can I do this kind of questions?

94
00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:30.245
I refrain from answering specific business questions,

95
00:05:30.245 --> 00:05:33.725
because in order to give an intelligent answer, I need

96
00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:38.125
to know a lot more than, uh, our time would allow us, okay?

97
00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:40.845
So, um, I am happy

98
00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:44.485
to answer general questions about marketing or innovation

99
00:05:44.905 --> 00:05:49.655
or strategy With that, um,

100
00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:55.135
any business, any size from any industry, B2B, B2C,

101
00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:59.285
startup, small business, whatever would require marketing

102
00:05:59.285 --> 00:06:00.725
to get to where they deserve to be.

103
00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:04.525
Okay? So this is the most important fact actually.

104
00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:10.045
Um, I have a friend who is a very able person, an engineer

105
00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:14.765
who is working on a very important technological project,

106
00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:18.505
um, in his company with his partner.

107
00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:21.065
I asked him the other day, you know,

108
00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:22.665
so what are you doing about?

109
00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:25.105
And he, he said, before I even asked him, he said,

110
00:06:25.415 --> 00:06:28.745
what makes me really scared is the marketing side of it.

111
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:30.625
I said, well, that's good.

112
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.985
You need to be scared because marketing is

113
00:06:33.045 --> 00:06:34.265
an important part of it.

114
00:06:34.285 --> 00:06:35.505
So what are you doing about it?

115
00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:37.585
He said, so, I'm in good hands.

116
00:06:37.825 --> 00:06:42.675
I have sort of handed over, handed it over to someone,

117
00:06:42.955 --> 00:06:44.275
a third party, an agency.

118
00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:48.855
I'm fine with it. As much as, you know, you are obliged

119
00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:50.535
to do this if you have a small team,

120
00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:52.815
or you don't have enough marketeers on your team,

121
00:06:53.335 --> 00:06:54.655
I think it's critical

122
00:06:54.885 --> 00:06:58.615
that you understand about marketing well enough to be able

123
00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:00.655
to steer the people to the right direction.

124
00:07:01.695 --> 00:07:06.395
So, um, just handing over that portion to a third party,

125
00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:11.275
uh, I don't think is gonna be the ideal way

126
00:07:11.275 --> 00:07:12.875
to go about marketing.

127
00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:16.395
Okay? So what I promise in this module is

128
00:07:16.775 --> 00:07:17.795
to give you pragmatic

129
00:07:17.815 --> 00:07:21.155
and practical examples, real world experiences,

130
00:07:21.455 --> 00:07:23.035
but also scientific knowledge,

131
00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:26.635
because as we frequently say in marketing, marketing

132
00:07:26.635 --> 00:07:29.115
or brand building is both art and science.

133
00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:33.555
There is a, there is a huge side science side to it,

134
00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:38.155
you know, databased, uh, you know, um, side

135
00:07:38.735 --> 00:07:40.795
to, you know, doing great marketing.

136
00:07:41.135 --> 00:07:45.475
So, but there's also an art side to marketing,

137
00:07:45.475 --> 00:07:47.155
which is about, you know, intuitions

138
00:07:47.295 --> 00:07:50.835
and understanding what's going on, the interpretations,

139
00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:52.715
the creativity, et cetera.

140
00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:56.755
So marketing is a great sort of merge between, um,

141
00:07:57.575 --> 00:08:00.955
coming together of the scientific data driven decision

142
00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:04.915
making, but also intuitive, um, aesthetically driven,

143
00:08:05.815 --> 00:08:08.555
um, creative side of things.

144
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.275
That's why I love it so much.

145
00:08:12.165 --> 00:08:15.105
Um, what is marketing in one word?

146
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.505
Like I said before, it's strategy.

147
00:08:17.805 --> 00:08:22.755
You know, technically everything you do,

148
00:08:22.975 --> 00:08:24.715
you know, every step, step you take,

149
00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:28.035
every decision you make about marketing, there has

150
00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:29.435
to be a strategy behind it.

151
00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:33.075
There has to be in other, in other words, a reason

152
00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:35.595
that you are doing that thing that you are doing.

153
00:08:35.655 --> 00:08:37.755
You need to be able to clarify in your mind

154
00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.595
why you are doing what you are doing, which is

155
00:08:40.595 --> 00:08:41.995
what strategy is about, really.

156
00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:47.035
Um, so at the very fundamental level,

157
00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:49.235
what is marketing's role?

158
00:08:49.545 --> 00:08:53.195
Marketing's role is actually understanding the need,

159
00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.845
responding to the need.

160
00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:58.805
And if your current solution, whether it's a product,

161
00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:03.445
physical product, or a service, is not good enough, then

162
00:09:04.385 --> 00:09:07.325
as marketeers we are, you know, we need

163
00:09:07.325 --> 00:09:10.445
to find better solutions to satisfy the need.

164
00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:15.795
So, you know, again, a couple of weeks ago I was discussing

165
00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:18.155
with some people what marketing is.

166
00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:22.315
And when this question came up, um, two of them said, well,

167
00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:23.555
marketing is communication.

168
00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:26.515
Well, certainly, you know, there is a component

169
00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:28.315
of marketing, which is about communication,

170
00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:30.315
which is about advertising and all of that.

171
00:09:30.975 --> 00:09:35.155
But to be able to communicate to the outside world, you need

172
00:09:35.155 --> 00:09:39.355
to first understand what the need is, what the strategy is,

173
00:09:39.355 --> 00:09:40.555
so that you can communicate

174
00:09:40.555 --> 00:09:42.195
with effectiveness and efficiency.

175
00:09:43.945 --> 00:09:48.645
If I told you, what does v remind you? What would you say?

176
00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:51.045
And I've asked this question in workshops

177
00:09:51.055 --> 00:09:53.725
where I have direct access to the, you know,

178
00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:58.605
to the audience, and usually I get from anywhere

179
00:09:58.605 --> 00:10:02.765
around the world the same answer, trust, safety,

180
00:10:03.225 --> 00:10:04.525
and innovation, right?

181
00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:07.925
I bet, um, you used one of these, you know,

182
00:10:07.925 --> 00:10:10.805
words in your mind when I ask you the question over there,

183
00:10:11.205 --> 00:10:12.645
wherever you are, all around the world.

184
00:10:13.545 --> 00:10:16.335
So why is that the case?

185
00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:20.655
Because literally, Volvo has been investing

186
00:10:21.485 --> 00:10:25.535
into safety and innovation for its lifetime.

187
00:10:25.835 --> 00:10:30.735
You know, it's one of the first, uh, brands to innovate,

188
00:10:31.235 --> 00:10:35.845
um, important, um, important technical,

189
00:10:35.845 --> 00:10:40.165
technological, uh, inventions, uh, within the, you know,

190
00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:43.485
autobi automobile industry, like in 59,

191
00:10:43.555 --> 00:10:44.845
they invented the seed belt,

192
00:10:45.025 --> 00:10:46.765
and they didn't keep it for themselves.

193
00:10:46.795 --> 00:10:50.325
They actually opened it to, to the whole industry to use it.

194
00:10:50.805 --> 00:10:52.965
A child seed was first invented by them.

195
00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:55.725
Exhaust emission control, side impact protection,

196
00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:59.285
the list goes on and on and on.

197
00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:02.965
So, the Volvo, Volvo has always been about safety

198
00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:05.605
and innovating for safety,

199
00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:08.685
and which created ultimately trust.

200
00:11:09.455 --> 00:11:14.315
So my first important message to you is that marketing

201
00:11:14.455 --> 00:11:17.355
or brand building isn't created through thin air.

202
00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:22.155
So marketeers are often told as people who would be able

203
00:11:22.155 --> 00:11:23.675
to sell anything they want.

204
00:11:23.735 --> 00:11:25.475
If you, if they're a good marketeer,

205
00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:28.795
good advertising person, good, whatever, you know,

206
00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:31.395
you can only do that for a very little amount of time.

207
00:11:31.975 --> 00:11:35.515
If the brand, if the product doesn't perform to

208
00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:38.555
what you are claiming it will do, then

209
00:11:38.645 --> 00:11:41.635
after a while, the fi it fizzles down,

210
00:11:41.695 --> 00:11:42.755
the message fizzles down.

211
00:11:42.755 --> 00:11:45.635
So the product performance, what you talk about

212
00:11:45.695 --> 00:11:50.155
as a marketeer, um, should be about reality,

213
00:11:50.775 --> 00:11:55.525
um, about the reality about the real authentic performance

214
00:11:55.665 --> 00:11:57.165
of the brand, of the product.

215
00:11:57.515 --> 00:12:00.125
Whether you are in a physical product industry,

216
00:12:00.225 --> 00:12:01.645
or a service industry,

217
00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:06.725
what you are claiming this brand will do should really do it

218
00:12:07.105 --> 00:12:09.085
to become the brand it's destined to be.

219
00:12:09.825 --> 00:12:11.515
What does Disney remind you?

220
00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:13.235
Okay, again, you know, from,

221
00:12:13.295 --> 00:12:14.635
you are from all over the world,

222
00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:18.195
but I bet you everything, you said something along the lines

223
00:12:18.255 --> 00:12:21.155
of family, entertainment, entertainment and magic.

224
00:12:22.155 --> 00:12:25.745
Again, why? Because Disney, since the times

225
00:12:25.765 --> 00:12:29.425
of Walt Disney has been investing into creating

226
00:12:30.305 --> 00:12:34.385
a safe environment, whether it's the team parks

227
00:12:34.485 --> 00:12:37.945
or the, you know, um, the movies, whatever,

228
00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:41.105
that the whole family can watch, entertain themselves,

229
00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:43.185
creating magic.

230
00:12:43.445 --> 00:12:44.825
That's what Disney is all about.

231
00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:48.505
The brand has invested all throughout the decades

232
00:12:49.565 --> 00:12:54.455
into those core ideas, into their message, uh,

233
00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:57.295
like that, you know, so things don't happen.

234
00:12:57.875 --> 00:13:00.655
The image doesn't get created.

235
00:13:01.435 --> 00:13:04.235
Um, you know, just

236
00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:09.895
by coincidence, brands, successful brands, invest

237
00:13:11.675 --> 00:13:16.485
time, resources, um, in a very focused way,

238
00:13:16.865 --> 00:13:18.445
uh, in creating the imagery.

239
00:13:19.305 --> 00:13:22.835
When I first joined Coke, the Coca-Cola company in 1996,

240
00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:25.395
we were invited to go to a meeting in Atlanta,

241
00:13:25.655 --> 00:13:29.675
and I went, so the Coca-Cola Museum, uh,

242
00:13:30.305 --> 00:13:31.835
back then still is there.

243
00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:34.715
It's, uh, it's fascinating, actually.

244
00:13:35.395 --> 00:13:38.915
I was so amazed to see, you know, um,

245
00:13:40.295 --> 00:13:43.195
the strategic foundation of the Coca-Cola brand

246
00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:48.035
to be quite similar, all across, across those decades.

247
00:13:48.545 --> 00:13:50.915
Like, you know, I could see promotions

248
00:13:51.135 --> 00:13:52.795
or advertising material,

249
00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:58.195
or sponsorships like Olympics from 1920s

250
00:13:58.855 --> 00:14:02.915
on till today, having, um, the same

251
00:14:03.515 --> 00:14:05.875
strategic foundational background.

252
00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:10.195
What changed was, of course, according to the site guys,

253
00:14:10.415 --> 00:14:15.275
the message that had to be, uh, applicable,

254
00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:17.275
uh, to this day.

255
00:14:17.615 --> 00:14:20.835
But otherwise, you could see, I could observe cons, uh,

256
00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:24.115
could consistency across all this time.

257
00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:26.755
So a brand is created with consistency,

258
00:14:26.755 --> 00:14:30.235
with focused messaging, which doesn't mean that, you know,

259
00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:32.035
you cannot change your strategy

260
00:14:32.175 --> 00:14:36.035
or you cannot adopt your strategy, adopt your messaging,

261
00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:39.475
or even make a mistake now and then, these are all okay,

262
00:14:40.055 --> 00:14:43.595
but as a trajectory, your brand has to be, you know,

263
00:14:43.825 --> 00:14:48.195
focused, uh, with a clear message, a consistent message

264
00:14:49.135 --> 00:14:50.235
all across the time.

265
00:14:51.135 --> 00:14:53.765
Peter Drucker, the famous consultant, says,

266
00:14:54.255 --> 00:14:57.765
there will always, one can assume be need for some selling,

267
00:14:58.425 --> 00:15:01.405
but the aim of marketing is to make selling super flows.

268
00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:03.525
The aim of marketing is to know

269
00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:06.125
and understand the customer so well that the product

270
00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:08.485
or service fits him and sells itself.

271
00:15:08.795 --> 00:15:11.165
Ideally, marketing should result in a customer

272
00:15:11.585 --> 00:15:12.645
who is ready to buy.

273
00:15:13.065 --> 00:15:16.165
All that should be needed then is to make the product

274
00:15:16.305 --> 00:15:17.645
or service available.

275
00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:21.125
Okay? Frequently marketing is mixed up with selling.

276
00:15:21.575 --> 00:15:26.125
These are complimentary functions or domains, um,

277
00:15:26.385 --> 00:15:27.965
but they are not the same thing.

278
00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:32.605
Selling is actively, you know, putting the product into, uh,

279
00:15:32.605 --> 00:15:35.205
the customer's hands in some fashion and form.

280
00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:40.765
Um, but marketing is, as Drucker says, um, to make the brand

281
00:15:41.465 --> 00:15:46.215
so well understood through the critical

282
00:15:46.805 --> 00:15:50.135
proposition and the message that the consumer

283
00:15:50.195 --> 00:15:53.855
and the user will pull it to herself or himself,

284
00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.775
because you're just explaining it so well to them.

285
00:15:58.715 --> 00:16:02.375
So if I look to brands, um, that defies centuries, like,

286
00:16:02.635 --> 00:16:05.695
you know, Coca-Cola, Volvo, Disney,

287
00:16:06.045 --> 00:16:07.495
what do they have in common?

288
00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:10.215
Um, consistency in strategy

289
00:16:10.315 --> 00:16:15.095
and execution, thorough marketing know-how brand building

290
00:16:15.095 --> 00:16:18.455
skills along with that innovation and creativity

291
00:16:19.275 --> 00:16:20.615
and constant learning

292
00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:23.175
and improving, you know, constant learning

293
00:16:23.355 --> 00:16:25.975
and improving in a systematic fashion,

294
00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:32.045
my screen doesn't react.

295
00:16:32.045 --> 00:16:36.885
Yeah. So, um, what is critical to be able

296
00:16:36.885 --> 00:16:39.325
to do that, to be good marketeers?

297
00:16:40.275 --> 00:16:43.095
What do we need to do for most?

298
00:16:43.645 --> 00:16:47.725
What comes first is really putting people at the center

299
00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:50.725
and really understanding their needs

300
00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:54.245
and wants thoroughly most important of all.

301
00:16:55.025 --> 00:16:58.565
So, as your business people, if you're working

302
00:16:58.565 --> 00:17:03.245
with marketeers, uh, you know, when they come to you

303
00:17:03.305 --> 00:17:06.685
to propose anything, a new campaign

304
00:17:07.905 --> 00:17:09.085
budget for this

305
00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:13.395
or that, um, I think you need

306
00:17:13.395 --> 00:17:17.795
to first ask this question, what are you satisfying?

307
00:17:18.025 --> 00:17:19.835
What need are you satisfying?

308
00:17:20.425 --> 00:17:23.435
What have you identified as the need of our users,

309
00:17:23.655 --> 00:17:26.515
of our consumers, so that you wanna respond

310
00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.595
with this campaign, with this and that?

311
00:17:29.505 --> 00:17:33.245
Uh, explain to me that should be your first question.

312
00:17:33.425 --> 00:17:38.085
You know, there is this famous debate about, well,

313
00:17:38.085 --> 00:17:41.125
marketing is about crafting the need,

314
00:17:41.485 --> 00:17:43.765
creating the need rather than satisfying the need

315
00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:44.925
or understanding the need.

316
00:17:44.925 --> 00:17:47.125
Marketing actually pushes the need.

317
00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:49.485
I completely disagree with that.

318
00:17:49.865 --> 00:17:54.725
You know, um, marketing's role, a great marketeer

319
00:17:55.465 --> 00:17:59.885
should be capable in deep diving into the consumer psyche,

320
00:17:59.885 --> 00:18:02.405
which we will talk in detail in the later sessions.

321
00:18:02.685 --> 00:18:05.405
Actually, really deep dive into the consumer psyche

322
00:18:05.405 --> 00:18:09.285
and understand what lies dormant, you know,

323
00:18:09.285 --> 00:18:13.125
through intelligent research, qualitative, ethnographic,

324
00:18:13.565 --> 00:18:16.645
whatever, design thinking, different methodologies, we'll,

325
00:18:16.645 --> 00:18:20.205
we'll talk about, um, and really understanding the need.

326
00:18:20.505 --> 00:18:23.525
You cannot sell anyone anything

327
00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:28.325
that they don't need at a fundamental level, at, at least

328
00:18:28.865 --> 00:18:31.845
not consistently for several decades,

329
00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:34.645
let alone 130 years like Coca-Cola.

330
00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:38.485
Okay? So understanding the need

331
00:18:39.425 --> 00:18:41.235
from a functional perspective, as well

332
00:18:41.235 --> 00:18:43.035
as emotional perspective is

333
00:18:43.385 --> 00:18:46.395
what great marketers do best.

334
00:18:47.535 --> 00:18:49.915
And it is such a fundamental question

335
00:18:49.985 --> 00:18:53.355
that everything we do from marketing campaigns

336
00:18:53.355 --> 00:18:56.395
and plans, et cetera, should rest upon that,

337
00:18:56.785 --> 00:18:58.035
upon understanding the need.

338
00:19:02.025 --> 00:19:06.765
Um, how else is this French company, um, agency, uh,

339
00:19:06.765 --> 00:19:09.005
they do amazing research each and every year.

340
00:19:09.035 --> 00:19:10.925
It's called Meaningful Brands report.

341
00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:14.445
Each year they have a new one in 2023.

342
00:19:15.225 --> 00:19:19.725
Um, they have found out that, you know, people,

343
00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:24.565
their respondents think that if 70% of brands disappeared,

344
00:19:25.405 --> 00:19:26.455
that they wouldn't care.

345
00:19:27.465 --> 00:19:32.205
Okay? So that's a shocking kind of data, right?

346
00:19:32.385 --> 00:19:34.525
So, how are we gonna read this?

347
00:19:34.525 --> 00:19:37.485
75% of brands disappeared, no one would care.

348
00:19:37.585 --> 00:19:41.325
So brands don't matter that, you know, we shouldn't be,

349
00:19:42.345 --> 00:19:44.205
you know, working on developing brands

350
00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.445
and investing so much money on developing brands.

351
00:19:47.515 --> 00:19:52.445
Just the contrary, you know, the 25%, you know,

352
00:19:52.895 --> 00:19:55.925
those brands that if they disappeared, people would care.

353
00:19:56.505 --> 00:19:58.125
We need to try to be one of them

354
00:19:58.945 --> 00:20:02.795
because the 75% we don't know about their future,

355
00:20:03.055 --> 00:20:05.035
we don't know about their business potential.

356
00:20:05.385 --> 00:20:08.275
Most likely they don't have a lot of future ahead of them.

357
00:20:09.305 --> 00:20:13.355
What creates importance in the mind of the user

358
00:20:13.895 --> 00:20:15.435
is meaning, you know,

359
00:20:15.435 --> 00:20:18.155
what makes a brand relevant in the eye of the people?

360
00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:21.675
Meaning the brands need to have a meaning.

361
00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:25.595
They need to satisfy something fundamental in the life

362
00:20:25.595 --> 00:20:27.635
of the consumer to stay relevant to them.

363
00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:32.405
Okay? How has research continues?

364
00:20:33.035 --> 00:20:35.885
Some brands have unlocked how to be meaningful

365
00:20:36.505 --> 00:20:38.965
and are significantly outperforming the

366
00:20:38.965 --> 00:20:40.405
market on all measures.

367
00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:44.445
So whether it's the overall impression, advocacy,

368
00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:49.365
advocating the brand, the intent repurchasing, whatever,

369
00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:52.325
premium price, ability to charge premium price,

370
00:20:52.675 --> 00:20:55.845
there's a significant difference between, um,

371
00:20:57.195 --> 00:21:00.085
high meaningful brand's performance versus

372
00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:02.645
low meaningful brand's performance.

373
00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:07.285
In other words, if your brand is identified to be one

374
00:21:07.285 --> 00:21:08.325
of the meaningful brands,

375
00:21:08.325 --> 00:21:10.965
meaning generating brands in the eye of the consumer,

376
00:21:11.475 --> 00:21:14.765
then you are given free reign by your users,

377
00:21:14.945 --> 00:21:19.765
by your consumers, um, to be relevant to them, you know,

378
00:21:19.785 --> 00:21:21.685
and that, that's what matters.

379
00:21:22.265 --> 00:21:26.405
That's the 25% we are aiming with great marketing.

380
00:21:27.025 --> 00:21:29.405
Um, I hear from, you know,

381
00:21:30.025 --> 00:21:34.445
I'm just consulting a startup right now in the area of,

382
00:21:34.545 --> 00:21:36.085
you know, really high tech

383
00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:40.205
and, um, the genius people are working on in the startup,

384
00:21:40.305 --> 00:21:43.445
you know, tech backgrounds, engineers, et cetera.

385
00:21:43.825 --> 00:21:47.245
Uh, they are, you know, geared towards rational thinking.

386
00:21:47.865 --> 00:21:51.845
So then, then when they hear marketing, they think, oh, wow,

387
00:21:52.035 --> 00:21:53.405
it's just mumbo jumbo.

388
00:21:53.405 --> 00:21:55.205
It's just talking some whatever.

389
00:21:55.425 --> 00:21:57.365
You know, we are here doing the real thing.

390
00:21:57.465 --> 00:21:59.605
We are making a difference through our technology,

391
00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:01.165
which is just great.

392
00:22:01.665 --> 00:22:05.205
But unless you're able to communicate what they're promising

393
00:22:05.865 --> 00:22:10.685
to your users, whoever they may, may be, B2B or B2C, uh,

394
00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:12.645
unless you are creating relevance

395
00:22:12.645 --> 00:22:14.965
and meaning in their lives, you're not gonna get

396
00:22:16.115 --> 00:22:19.725
very far away, even if your solution is a

397
00:22:19.725 --> 00:22:21.005
genius kind of solution.

398
00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:26.515
Okay, so, Haas continuous, I'm sorry,

399
00:22:26.635 --> 00:22:28.795
I just need to sometimes stop for a moment

400
00:22:29.055 --> 00:22:30.915
and clean up my screen.

401
00:22:31.145 --> 00:22:35.265
Yeah. Uh, so the other,

402
00:22:35.445 --> 00:22:39.105
the other interesting thing is that people really care

403
00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:43.825
for brands, um, in terms of, you know,

404
00:22:43.975 --> 00:22:48.735
when asked the power

405
00:22:48.835 --> 00:22:51.775
to influence or affect more positive change in the world,

406
00:22:52.465 --> 00:22:54.735
which institutions have more power,

407
00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:59.335
brands are ranked number two in terms

408
00:22:59.555 --> 00:23:03.215
of impacting society, uh, with positive change

409
00:23:03.355 --> 00:23:06.335
or impacting people's lives with positive change.

410
00:23:07.035 --> 00:23:09.855
Uh, brands are ranked number two consistently.

411
00:23:10.275 --> 00:23:15.055
People actually give support to brands in terms of,

412
00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:20.655
um, you know, if they are great brands, if they are run

413
00:23:20.655 --> 00:23:22.855
with purpose, that they can affect

414
00:23:23.175 --> 00:23:24.335
positive change in their lives.

415
00:23:24.715 --> 00:23:28.695
So the first slide about the 70 per 5%

416
00:23:28.695 --> 00:23:30.775
of brands when they disappeared, no one would care,

417
00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:33.535
you know, might scare us,

418
00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:35.855
but it's at the same time teaching us

419
00:23:35.855 --> 00:23:39.575
that we have a very important role, uh,

420
00:23:40.555 --> 00:23:42.535
as marketeers, as business people,

421
00:23:42.995 --> 00:23:47.045
and that is to make our brand relevant, relevant

422
00:23:47.305 --> 00:23:49.765
to the need needs of people.

423
00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:52.605
That's what marketing is, really, that's

424
00:23:52.605 --> 00:23:54.525
what strategic marketing is all about.

425
00:23:55.985 --> 00:23:57.645
So if you look to the, um,

426
00:23:58.945 --> 00:24:02.365
to the very successful companies like Coca-Cola, p and g,

427
00:24:02.585 --> 00:24:05.405
and Unilever, and I consider those three actually the

428
00:24:05.405 --> 00:24:06.685
marketing schools of this world,

429
00:24:07.105 --> 00:24:09.525
and I am privileged to have worked for two of them,

430
00:24:09.645 --> 00:24:10.925
Unilever and p and g.

431
00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:15.485
Um, they are consistently good at what they're doing

432
00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:18.885
because they, they're very strategic.

433
00:24:19.425 --> 00:24:21.725
Uh, they build their know-how upon the

434
00:24:21.725 --> 00:24:23.005
needs and wants of people.

435
00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:27.045
They are very able in communicating, um,

436
00:24:27.945 --> 00:24:29.485
and highlighting the emotional

437
00:24:29.505 --> 00:24:32.725
and functional benefits of their brands and products.

438
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:37.565
And they're very able to continuously innovate

439
00:24:37.865 --> 00:24:39.765
to understand the, you know, the need

440
00:24:39.985 --> 00:24:43.165
and see where they are missing out,

441
00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:48.245
and then innovating, uh, to be able to, you know,

442
00:24:48.245 --> 00:24:53.035
deliver the best, um, uh,

443
00:24:53.215 --> 00:24:54.555
the best experience

444
00:24:54.555 --> 00:24:56.875
that their brand can provide to the consumers.

445
00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:01.655
So again, you know, I, I wanna highlight this.

446
00:25:01.805 --> 00:25:04.495
Some of you I'm sure are small business owners

447
00:25:04.715 --> 00:25:07.135
or solopreneurs like myself, right?

448
00:25:07.595 --> 00:25:11.855
So you might think, why do I care what those brands do?

449
00:25:11.855 --> 00:25:16.255
They have these horrendous budgets, uh,

450
00:25:16.255 --> 00:25:18.855
amazing budgets, and I'm a small business.

451
00:25:19.015 --> 00:25:21.415
I don't have enough marketers. What do I care?

452
00:25:22.095 --> 00:25:25.655
I think we should care most to learn about marketing,

453
00:25:25.845 --> 00:25:27.095
like I said in the beginning.

454
00:25:27.755 --> 00:25:29.695
Um, because the size of your business,

455
00:25:29.955 --> 00:25:32.735
and you know what, what line of your business does,

456
00:25:32.735 --> 00:25:34.255
does not matter in what sector

457
00:25:34.355 --> 00:25:36.455
or industry you work does not matter.

458
00:25:37.205 --> 00:25:40.775
What will differentiate you in the marketplace is, um,

459
00:25:41.075 --> 00:25:44.495
the way your brand stands out in the mind of the consumer,

460
00:25:44.495 --> 00:25:46.855
in the minds of the consumers, okay?

461
00:25:47.355 --> 00:25:51.475
So if you don't have, you know,

462
00:25:51.595 --> 00:25:54.795
a marketing theme, well, unfortunately, then, uh,

463
00:25:55.095 --> 00:26:00.075
or fortunately, this job rests with you being a marketeer.

464
00:26:04.005 --> 00:26:06.505
Um, because we live in a complicated century.

465
00:26:06.725 --> 00:26:10.825
You know, I call this a century of dichotomies.

466
00:26:11.635 --> 00:26:15.585
Sorry, guys. Sometimes my screen, my cursor doesn't react.

467
00:26:15.845 --> 00:26:18.105
So that's why I stop for a minute to,

468
00:26:21.295 --> 00:26:22.305
okay, here it is.

469
00:26:22.395 --> 00:26:26.275
Sorry about that. A century of dichotomies,

470
00:26:26.275 --> 00:26:28.595
because there are huge opportunities

471
00:26:28.695 --> 00:26:31.155
and there are huge problems at the same time, right?

472
00:26:31.555 --> 00:26:35.355
I mean, abundance versus sustainability, it's one

473
00:26:35.355 --> 00:26:37.675
of the most abundant times in the history

474
00:26:37.735 --> 00:26:39.075
of the human beings.

475
00:26:39.655 --> 00:26:41.635
Yet, in terms of sustainability issues,

476
00:26:42.465 --> 00:26:43.845
it's one of the worst ever.

477
00:26:44.265 --> 00:26:48.445
And it's getting more troublesome by today.

478
00:26:49.145 --> 00:26:53.325
Uh, we have like accessibility in terms

479
00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:56.125
of internet, in terms of, you know, global thinking,

480
00:26:56.225 --> 00:27:00.205
in terms of global, um, commerce,

481
00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:05.165
um, uh, you know, globalization at the same time affects

482
00:27:05.685 --> 00:27:07.805
everyone in the positive manner,

483
00:27:08.305 --> 00:27:09.885
but also in the negative manner.

484
00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:14.365
Um, up till Covid hit us, uh,

485
00:27:14.745 --> 00:27:17.205
the middle income levels were increasing

486
00:27:17.205 --> 00:27:18.245
really, really rapidly.

487
00:27:19.055 --> 00:27:21.285
Covid unfortunately stalled it,

488
00:27:21.345 --> 00:27:24.565
but hopefully, you know, the trajectory will come back.

489
00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:29.685
And so, um, the welfare is despite all the issues,

490
00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:33.605
uh, facing human beings in certain geographies,

491
00:27:33.705 --> 00:27:35.165
but still, the trajectory is

492
00:27:35.165 --> 00:27:37.125
to a higher middle income levels.

493
00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:40.005
And obviously, role of technology is

494
00:27:40.835 --> 00:27:44.045
generally improving the lifestyle, um,

495
00:27:44.915 --> 00:27:47.325
with like health reforms on its way.

496
00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:50.445
And, um, in general, effectiveness

497
00:27:50.465 --> 00:27:53.165
and efficiency increasing for human beings.

498
00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:55.005
So there are a lot of problems,

499
00:27:55.025 --> 00:27:57.085
but there are also a lot of opportunities.

500
00:27:58.025 --> 00:28:01.245
So in this kind of climate where anything seems

501
00:28:01.265 --> 00:28:06.165
to be possible, um, brands still do fail big time, you know?

502
00:28:06.745 --> 00:28:10.285
And if you look to products of this world, the Borders,

503
00:28:10.285 --> 00:28:14.725
which is this bookstore, um, in the us I loved Borders.

504
00:28:14.805 --> 00:28:17.685
I had one of them at my co at the corner of

505
00:28:17.685 --> 00:28:19.045
where I used to live.

506
00:28:19.605 --> 00:28:21.645
I used to go there often, and then they disappeared.

507
00:28:21.845 --> 00:28:25.445
Suddenly the Blockbuster video again, you know, um,

508
00:28:26.965 --> 00:28:28.125
I, if I'm not mistaken,

509
00:28:28.465 --> 00:28:31.205
at one point they had like 900 stores

510
00:28:31.305 --> 00:28:33.125
or something, you know, with rental

511
00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:36.085
in every mall, strip mall.

512
00:28:36.085 --> 00:28:39.765
They had one blockbuster video in the us. Toys are us.

513
00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:42.645
You know, what, what did they, why did they fail?

514
00:28:42.865 --> 00:28:45.765
We said, strategy is critical. Communication is critical.

515
00:28:45.765 --> 00:28:48.285
Innovation is critical. Why did they fail?

516
00:28:49.575 --> 00:28:51.195
Let me give you an example of Kodak.

517
00:28:51.965 --> 00:28:54.015
Some of you might have heard the story,

518
00:28:54.035 --> 00:28:57.535
but Kodak, uh, actually is the, the company

519
00:28:58.635 --> 00:29:00.495
who invented digital camera.

520
00:29:00.945 --> 00:29:03.255
First time ever in 1975,

521
00:29:03.865 --> 00:29:06.735
while no one had even heard about it, an engineer,

522
00:29:07.175 --> 00:29:10.455
a named Steve Sason invented, um,

523
00:29:10.835 --> 00:29:12.975
the digital camera in 1975.

524
00:29:13.635 --> 00:29:17.745
Um, especially the middle management at Kodak.

525
00:29:17.885 --> 00:29:22.795
The company didn't think it's of any importance

526
00:29:22.855 --> 00:29:23.955
of any meaning, really.

527
00:29:24.305 --> 00:29:26.235
They said, well, we are in the film business.

528
00:29:26.235 --> 00:29:28.075
What are we gonna do with this digital thing?

529
00:29:29.145 --> 00:29:32.875
What struck me very much is when I researched

530
00:29:34.095 --> 00:29:38.955
how Kak behaved at the time, I came across to the CEO's, um,

531
00:29:40.465 --> 00:29:43.925
you know, new the news about

532
00:29:43.925 --> 00:29:47.325
what CEO said about their brand, their CEO said,

533
00:29:47.705 --> 00:29:49.965
at the time, we are a chemical company,

534
00:29:52.385 --> 00:29:53.695
which hits me very much

535
00:29:53.695 --> 00:29:56.855
because I remember I used to ha own an analog camera,

536
00:29:57.355 --> 00:29:59.815
and I used to go to the Kodak shop.

537
00:30:00.525 --> 00:30:02.015
This is during nineties

538
00:30:02.035 --> 00:30:04.295
and beginning, you know, uh, two thousands.

539
00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:06.095
I used to go to the Kodak shop to

540
00:30:06.655 --> 00:30:08.335
purchase film for my camera.

541
00:30:09.065 --> 00:30:12.905
Never in a million years have I thought of Kodak

542
00:30:12.965 --> 00:30:16.265
as a chemical product and a chemical company.

543
00:30:17.265 --> 00:30:20.865
Kodak, for me, was a filmmaker, uh,

544
00:30:21.045 --> 00:30:24.865
who produced films so that I can shoot exceptional,

545
00:30:25.215 --> 00:30:26.745
beautiful photography.

546
00:30:27.565 --> 00:30:31.545
And yet the CEO completely, uh, neglected

547
00:30:31.575 --> 00:30:35.825
that side of their brand, which is, you know, creation,

548
00:30:36.885 --> 00:30:40.545
beauty, aesthetics, capturing the moments life.

549
00:30:41.285 --> 00:30:43.905
And he called themselves, we are a chemical company.

550
00:30:45.085 --> 00:30:47.905
Had they thought of themselves as, you know,

551
00:30:48.825 --> 00:30:52.065
creating moments, crafting moments, creating memories,

552
00:30:52.495 --> 00:30:56.145
perhaps the digital camera that they invented

553
00:30:56.245 --> 00:30:59.385
before everyone else could have had a meaning

554
00:30:59.405 --> 00:31:01.575
for them, but they didn't.

555
00:31:02.035 --> 00:31:06.255
So, the way you see yourself, the way you define yourself,

556
00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:09.215
the way you talk about yourself is the

557
00:31:09.215 --> 00:31:11.055
foundation of brand building.

558
00:31:11.555 --> 00:31:13.615
And you can hit or miss

559
00:31:14.035 --> 00:31:17.415
or leverage the opportunities depending

560
00:31:17.515 --> 00:31:18.935
how you define yourself.

561
00:31:19.995 --> 00:31:21.805
Blockbuster, well, versus Netflix.

562
00:31:23.225 --> 00:31:27.205
So, blockbuster, as I said, was available in the us.

563
00:31:27.405 --> 00:31:28.405
I remember I moved

564
00:31:28.405 --> 00:31:32.645
to us in 2002 at every corner in every strip mall, really?

565
00:31:33.305 --> 00:31:36.245
Um, yeah, 9,000 shops.

566
00:31:36.245 --> 00:31:41.045
They had, uh, actually an 84,000 employees at the height

567
00:31:41.105 --> 00:31:45.725
of their business, and then came along Netflix again.

568
00:31:45.785 --> 00:31:48.205
How did Blockbuster treat their business?

569
00:31:48.275 --> 00:31:52.095
They were almost like in, you know, real estate business.

570
00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:53.375
They had to be everywhere

571
00:31:53.525 --> 00:31:57.895
because they were, it was about for them being present,

572
00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:01.055
um, in every critical location.

573
00:32:01.965 --> 00:32:03.335
Have they considered themselves

574
00:32:03.355 --> 00:32:05.815
as an entertainment company like Netflix did?

575
00:32:06.595 --> 00:32:07.815
I'm not sure actually.

576
00:32:08.195 --> 00:32:09.455
So Netflix comes in

577
00:32:09.715 --> 00:32:12.615
and thinks of themselves, true, of course, the power

578
00:32:12.615 --> 00:32:14.335
of technology and data.

579
00:32:15.235 --> 00:32:18.855
Um, they create such a foundation that they can, you know,

580
00:32:18.965 --> 00:32:21.815
talk to everyone and everyone's vicious

581
00:32:22.035 --> 00:32:26.505
and interest, um, in a more effective

582
00:32:26.505 --> 00:32:29.645
and efficient way with, I dunno,

583
00:32:29.645 --> 00:32:33.245
300 million sub subscribers, subscribers at the moment.

584
00:32:33.705 --> 00:32:35.165
So, what does marketing enable?

585
00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:39.725
It helps represent the brand to the outside world so

586
00:32:39.725 --> 00:32:42.245
that it is perceived as intended.

587
00:32:42.835 --> 00:32:46.045
Okay? Had AK perceived itself

588
00:32:47.555 --> 00:32:51.685
different than merely a chemical company, they would've

589
00:32:52.485 --> 00:32:54.085
represented themselves to the outside world

590
00:32:54.225 --> 00:32:55.965
as such, but they didn't.

591
00:32:56.665 --> 00:33:00.565
So our role as marketeers is to understand, um,

592
00:33:01.795 --> 00:33:05.525
what our brand is all about, what our products deliver,

593
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:07.365
and then we find strategies

594
00:33:08.065 --> 00:33:12.605
and vehicles, communication strategies to talk about that

595
00:33:13.185 --> 00:33:14.365
to our target audience.

596
00:33:15.425 --> 00:33:19.245
Um, marketing gives us the ability to meet our customers

597
00:33:19.455 --> 00:33:21.725
where they want to be met, okay?

598
00:33:21.985 --> 00:33:25.365
The place they want to be met, satisfy their needs,

599
00:33:25.425 --> 00:33:28.805
the way they would express themselves, be relevant

600
00:33:28.805 --> 00:33:32.485
and meaningful in their lives, anticipate their needs

601
00:33:32.545 --> 00:33:35.965
before they are even aware of their needs,

602
00:33:36.585 --> 00:33:39.805
and give reasons to our cus cus consumers to love

603
00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:42.155
and cherish our brand.

604
00:33:42.775 --> 00:33:46.535
That's our role. That's what we are trying to do.

605
00:33:48.255 --> 00:33:50.715
And in this module, we are gonna talk about many things,

606
00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:54.675
and today's is an introduction about what marketing is

607
00:33:54.675 --> 00:33:56.395
and what brand development does.

608
00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:59.035
Um, but it's a systems thinking.

609
00:33:59.185 --> 00:34:02.475
Marketing is a systematic approach, um,

610
00:34:04.055 --> 00:34:07.595
to, you know, creating a centennial brand, right?

611
00:34:08.215 --> 00:34:09.835
And what does it start with?

612
00:34:09.895 --> 00:34:13.515
It starts with having a strong brand identity, you know,

613
00:34:13.515 --> 00:34:14.875
we call brand positioning.

614
00:34:15.095 --> 00:34:17.475
And in the next session I'm gonna talk about that

615
00:34:18.145 --> 00:34:21.995
your brand positioning is your sort of the foundation

616
00:34:23.135 --> 00:34:25.675
of everything your brand stands for.

617
00:34:26.175 --> 00:34:29.915
Um, technically you shouldn't be allowed to do anything

618
00:34:30.785 --> 00:34:33.915
outside of your brand's positioning, outside

619
00:34:33.935 --> 00:34:37.835
of your definition of what your brand stands for.

620
00:34:38.555 --> 00:34:43.075
I have seen people getting fired for doing something

621
00:34:43.595 --> 00:34:46.355
contrary to what the brand stands for.

622
00:34:46.455 --> 00:34:50.355
You know, they did activate the brand in ways which was not

623
00:34:50.355 --> 00:34:51.835
acceptable, and they were fired.

624
00:34:52.615 --> 00:34:54.955
Um, then we will talk about marketing mix

625
00:34:54.955 --> 00:34:58.675
and marketing strategies, brand loyalty

626
00:34:59.335 --> 00:35:00.915
and customer centricity,

627
00:35:01.275 --> 00:35:04.915
customer centricity being such an important vehicle

628
00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:08.675
phrase in today's marketing world.

629
00:35:09.575 --> 00:35:10.995
Um, growth strategies.

630
00:35:11.925 --> 00:35:14.065
Um, we are gonna talk about communication plan

631
00:35:14.065 --> 00:35:17.745
and strategies, sustainable brands, part

632
00:35:17.745 --> 00:35:19.625
of everything in today's world.

633
00:35:20.325 --> 00:35:24.345
Uh, having the right KPIs, having the right metrics, uh,

634
00:35:24.345 --> 00:35:25.465
to measure performance.

635
00:35:25.965 --> 00:35:27.105
And of course, innovation.

636
00:35:27.735 --> 00:35:30.705
Nothing happens without inno innovation

637
00:35:30.765 --> 00:35:32.425
and innovative thinking these days.

638
00:35:34.195 --> 00:35:36.335
So I just wanna sort of, um,

639
00:35:37.295 --> 00:35:41.245
point out highlights some of the most critical elements

640
00:35:41.245 --> 00:35:42.245
that I just mentioned.

641
00:35:45.595 --> 00:35:49.825
Um, In the next session,

642
00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:54.505
we will talk about, um, crafting, um, a brand positioning,

643
00:35:55.585 --> 00:35:58.695
irrelevant brand positioning, a brand house for our brands.

644
00:35:59.585 --> 00:36:02.095
Again, um, I can almost hear you.

645
00:36:02.165 --> 00:36:05.495
Some of you, you might say, well, I I'm just me.

646
00:36:05.875 --> 00:36:07.175
Why do I need a brand house?

647
00:36:07.795 --> 00:36:10.415
Me as a consultant, solopreneur,

648
00:36:10.595 --> 00:36:11.775
why do I need a brand house?

649
00:36:12.415 --> 00:36:16.375
I don't necessarily, you know, design a brand house,

650
00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:21.535
but in my mind, I know me as a live consulting,

651
00:36:22.175 --> 00:36:25.775
I know in my mind what I should stand for in the minds of

652
00:36:26.675 --> 00:36:30.815
my consumers, in the minds of my clients and my customers.

653
00:36:31.675 --> 00:36:35.015
And I know that I need

654
00:36:35.335 --> 00:36:40.015
to craft this identity, um, according

655
00:36:40.275 --> 00:36:43.895
to what I believe is gonna be most impactful

656
00:36:44.595 --> 00:36:46.495
in the minds of my clients.

657
00:36:47.535 --> 00:36:51.875
And while I'm crafting this identity, I need to make sure

658
00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:54.875
that it's actually authentic and real.

659
00:36:55.375 --> 00:36:59.835
And whatever message I'm trying to give is actually

660
00:37:00.765 --> 00:37:02.355
rests upon reality.

661
00:37:02.855 --> 00:37:06.755
So when I'm standing here in front of you, as you know,

662
00:37:08.205 --> 00:37:09.905
and I've got the brand, the consultant,

663
00:37:09.965 --> 00:37:13.305
and I'm talking about marketing, I need to make sure that I,

664
00:37:13.305 --> 00:37:16.345
that I know what I'm talking about, that I am reliable,

665
00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:18.865
that I'm trustworthy, that you can rely

666
00:37:18.865 --> 00:37:21.545
and trust me that I'm gonna say something relevant

667
00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:22.585
and meaningful to you.

668
00:37:23.445 --> 00:37:26.785
Uh, so the brand identity of complicated brands,

669
00:37:26.785 --> 00:37:29.345
that billion dollar brands are no different, really.

670
00:37:29.785 --> 00:37:32.905
I mean, at, at the principle, it's very simple.

671
00:37:33.645 --> 00:37:37.665
We need to identify what makes sense, what is relevant,

672
00:37:37.775 --> 00:37:40.145
what is meaningful for our consumers,

673
00:37:40.485 --> 00:37:43.505
and then we need to craft the right stories to be able

674
00:37:43.525 --> 00:37:47.615
to tell them and own that story as a brand.

675
00:37:48.155 --> 00:37:51.535
And while doing that, we need to make sure that as a brand,

676
00:37:51.595 --> 00:37:54.255
we are really delivering on that promise,

677
00:37:54.735 --> 00:37:55.815
whatever we are promising.

678
00:37:56.635 --> 00:37:59.815
So crafting the brand, positioning in the form

679
00:37:59.815 --> 00:38:02.655
of the brand house that we, marketeers call,

680
00:38:03.355 --> 00:38:06.855
is really about putting our best foot forward

681
00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:10.255
and having this one page document,

682
00:38:10.305 --> 00:38:13.975
which is gonna be our north star, um,

683
00:38:15.585 --> 00:38:19.565
to show us all of us working for the brand, for the company,

684
00:38:20.185 --> 00:38:23.805
how we should behave, what to do, and what not to do.

685
00:38:23.915 --> 00:38:27.285
Okay? So we are gonna be talking about that next, uh,

686
00:38:27.345 --> 00:38:28.765
in the next, uh, session.

687
00:38:31.005 --> 00:38:34.785
And the third lecture will be about brand purpose.

688
00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:37.005
And brand purpose is a concept

689
00:38:37.195 --> 00:38:39.045
that emerged about 10 years ago,

690
00:38:39.545 --> 00:38:43.445
and every day it has become even more important, um,

691
00:38:44.545 --> 00:38:47.445
in this day and age where, like I mentioned, there's,

692
00:38:47.445 --> 00:38:50.525
there are a lot of issues about sustainability, you know,

693
00:38:52.295 --> 00:38:53.675
uh, climate change,

694
00:38:54.335 --> 00:38:57.715
social injustices, you name it.

695
00:38:58.535 --> 00:39:02.945
Um, people are putting, like I showed you

696
00:39:02.945 --> 00:39:06.785
before, you know, harvest research results, um, state

697
00:39:06.815 --> 00:39:09.665
that brands are trusted only second

698
00:39:09.665 --> 00:39:11.545
after, you know, governments, et cetera,

699
00:39:11.545 --> 00:39:12.985
to make a positive change.

700
00:39:13.645 --> 00:39:18.225
So because of that, brands are, you know, held hold,

701
00:39:18.405 --> 00:39:21.785
are held responsible in today's climate

702
00:39:22.445 --> 00:39:23.825
to do good for the world.

703
00:39:23.925 --> 00:39:27.425
So it's no longer enough to to just say, well,

704
00:39:27.805 --> 00:39:30.825
I'm a commercial business

705
00:39:31.645 --> 00:39:36.285
and my role is just to make money for my shareholders,

706
00:39:36.985 --> 00:39:41.925
is no longer acceptable in, um, today's climate

707
00:39:42.345 --> 00:39:43.885
for the Gen Zs of this world,

708
00:39:44.025 --> 00:39:46.805
for the millennial millennials of this world.

709
00:39:46.825 --> 00:39:49.525
And we will talk about that. And I think there's a lot

710
00:39:49.525 --> 00:39:50.685
of relevance for that.

711
00:39:50.705 --> 00:39:52.365
If you're a small business owner

712
00:39:52.465 --> 00:39:54.925
or a large business owner, it, it doesn't matter.

713
00:39:55.375 --> 00:39:58.285
Brand purpose is a transformative power, uh,

714
00:39:58.315 --> 00:40:00.525
that has implications for the whole organization

715
00:40:00.525 --> 00:40:01.925
that you need to be aware of.

716
00:40:03.575 --> 00:40:05.585
Marketing mix. I'm, you, I'm sure you heard

717
00:40:05.585 --> 00:40:06.905
of the four P's of marketing.

718
00:40:06.905 --> 00:40:11.025
The traditional sort of, uh, marketing strategy foundation,

719
00:40:11.725 --> 00:40:14.185
uh, is at the center of every marketing strategy.

720
00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:18.425
And, uh, we used to call it four Ps of marketing,

721
00:40:18.425 --> 00:40:20.105
the product, the price, the promotion,

722
00:40:20.105 --> 00:40:24.545
and the place, uh, the, now it's like sometimes six Ps,

723
00:40:24.545 --> 00:40:25.985
seven Ps, eight Ps.

724
00:40:26.625 --> 00:40:29.385
I have included two more the technological

725
00:40:29.785 --> 00:40:31.025
revolution and what it means.

726
00:40:31.025 --> 00:40:34.585
Because if you look to, um, to, uh,

727
00:40:35.325 --> 00:40:39.745
the blockbuster example, if you look to toys us, if you look

728
00:40:39.765 --> 00:40:42.985
to, you know, borders, they've missed the boat

729
00:40:43.055 --> 00:40:46.105
because of the relevance, uh,

730
00:40:46.105 --> 00:40:48.345
because of the meaning they have, you know,

731
00:40:48.405 --> 00:40:50.905
put on their own, on their brands, but also

732
00:40:51.055 --> 00:40:53.305
because they've missed the meaning

733
00:40:53.605 --> 00:40:55.225
of technological revolution

734
00:40:55.325 --> 00:40:56.825
and the relevance for their brand.

735
00:40:56.895 --> 00:40:58.545
Okay? So that's gonna be important.

736
00:40:59.045 --> 00:41:02.465
And stakeholders, stakeholders meaning not only your target

737
00:41:02.865 --> 00:41:06.825
audience, but everybody who is somehow touching your brand,

738
00:41:07.095 --> 00:41:09.905
from your employees to your families, to your vendors,

739
00:41:10.325 --> 00:41:11.545
to you name it.

740
00:41:11.695 --> 00:41:14.105
Okay? We are gonna talk about it next week

741
00:41:15.265 --> 00:41:16.655
about the marketing mix.

742
00:41:17.315 --> 00:41:21.215
Uh, and it's impor, you know, together with the brand house,

743
00:41:21.355 --> 00:41:25.015
the positioning, the marketing mix are the two most

744
00:41:25.085 --> 00:41:27.855
important foundational methodologies

745
00:41:28.595 --> 00:41:30.695
of crafting a brand.

746
00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:35.525
So every marketer needs to learn to,

747
00:41:35.705 --> 00:41:40.525
you know, um, to articulate the brand proposition along

748
00:41:40.675 --> 00:41:43.325
with a strong marketing mix, uh, to be able

749
00:41:43.325 --> 00:41:46.045
to craft meaningful strategies for the brand.

750
00:41:48.375 --> 00:41:52.275
Um, customer centricity is so much talked about,

751
00:41:52.535 --> 00:41:53.675
and you know,

752
00:41:53.925 --> 00:41:57.515
every business owner almost automatically states, well,

753
00:41:57.735 --> 00:42:00.155
we are a customer centric organization, right?

754
00:42:00.895 --> 00:42:04.995
Uh, because customer centricity is often understood to mean,

755
00:42:05.865 --> 00:42:07.525
you know, we put people first.

756
00:42:07.705 --> 00:42:11.525
We put our customers first. We listen to our customers.

757
00:42:11.745 --> 00:42:16.165
We, they're important to us. Of course, they are no doubt.

758
00:42:16.425 --> 00:42:20.285
But customer centricity is a systemic, systematic approach.

759
00:42:20.945 --> 00:42:24.525
Um, to understand your customers,

760
00:42:25.295 --> 00:42:28.765
offer them solutions, segment them m

761
00:42:31.105 --> 00:42:34.485
in a data-driven, intelligent fashion, so that you

762
00:42:34.545 --> 00:42:38.805
as a brand have a clear understanding how to talk to each

763
00:42:38.805 --> 00:42:42.605
of your segments, how to leverage each of your segments

764
00:42:43.145 --> 00:42:47.165
to the benefit of your brand while adding value, um,

765
00:42:47.795 --> 00:42:51.125
into their lives, into your, into your customer's lives.

766
00:42:51.315 --> 00:42:53.445
Okay? So there's a systematic approach

767
00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:54.965
to customer centricity in terms

768
00:42:54.965 --> 00:42:57.205
of customer lifetime value, et cetera.

769
00:42:58.145 --> 00:43:01.685
Um, along with that comes, of course, uh,

770
00:43:02.385 --> 00:43:03.565
the growth pillars

771
00:43:03.705 --> 00:43:06.405
and the growth drivers, um,

772
00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:10.115
what I would call growth strategies.

773
00:43:10.695 --> 00:43:15.685
Um, we are gonna

774
00:43:15.955 --> 00:43:19.895
reserve one of the lectures on thinking about

775
00:43:20.555 --> 00:43:23.135
growth strategies as brands.

776
00:43:24.415 --> 00:43:28.515
We have several roads ahead of us.

777
00:43:29.485 --> 00:43:31.535
Sometimes we have one target audience,

778
00:43:32.315 --> 00:43:35.215
but frequently we have a premium target audience,

779
00:43:35.215 --> 00:43:38.455
secondary target audiences, even tertiary target audiences.

780
00:43:39.195 --> 00:43:42.135
We have, um, different SKUs.

781
00:43:42.275 --> 00:43:45.295
We use different channels of distribution.

782
00:43:45.995 --> 00:43:49.855
Um, we have, you know, we are segmenting our markets

783
00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:55.505
and usually most of the time, not

784
00:43:56.045 --> 00:43:59.745
all of those components deliver us a similar

785
00:44:00.485 --> 00:44:01.545
amount of return.

786
00:44:02.485 --> 00:44:07.075
You know, there are, um, pillars

787
00:44:07.505 --> 00:44:11.715
that deliver us most return, um, in comparison

788
00:44:11.895 --> 00:44:14.475
to other aspects of our business.

789
00:44:15.015 --> 00:44:16.555
So we need to be aware of

790
00:44:17.465 --> 00:44:21.995
what gets us most return versus what aspect

791
00:44:21.995 --> 00:44:25.595
of our business gets us lesser returns.

792
00:44:26.615 --> 00:44:28.875
All of them can be critical and important,

793
00:44:29.335 --> 00:44:32.885
but to be able to grow effectively, we need to be able

794
00:44:32.885 --> 00:44:36.525
to segment and differentiate our growth vectors,

795
00:44:36.985 --> 00:44:39.685
our growth pillars than the rest of our business.

796
00:44:40.425 --> 00:44:43.805
So, um, in that lecture, we're gonna be talking about

797
00:44:44.195 --> 00:44:46.405
that systematically, how to approach, how

798
00:44:46.405 --> 00:44:49.645
to understand our growth pillars in how to, you know,

799
00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:51.445
focus on, on our growth pillars

800
00:44:53.125 --> 00:44:54.945
and communication.

801
00:44:55.265 --> 00:44:59.945
Strategy and plan are, um, the outside voice

802
00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:02.345
to the world of our brand.

803
00:45:02.845 --> 00:45:04.785
And again, unfortunately,

804
00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:08.025
usually when people think about marketing, the first,

805
00:45:08.565 --> 00:45:12.435
the first, uh, component of marketing that comes

806
00:45:12.435 --> 00:45:16.035
to mind is advertising, you know, advertising, social media,

807
00:45:16.435 --> 00:45:17.435
advertising, et cetera.

808
00:45:18.855 --> 00:45:23.615
Advertising is a vehicle, a tool, um, which is only

809
00:45:24.385 --> 00:45:26.695
meaningful, which is only effective

810
00:45:26.695 --> 00:45:29.215
and efficient as long as it's strategic.

811
00:45:29.925 --> 00:45:32.785
And by strategic, I mean, as long as we know

812
00:45:33.135 --> 00:45:36.265
what we are communicating to whom

813
00:45:37.405 --> 00:45:40.505
is relevant and meaningful for that audience.

814
00:45:41.165 --> 00:45:44.725
So our communication plan,

815
00:45:45.185 --> 00:45:49.855
our advertising execution, need to be guided

816
00:45:51.465 --> 00:45:55.985
by our strategy, by our brand strategy, followed

817
00:45:56.245 --> 00:45:59.825
by our communication strategy, which is driven out

818
00:45:59.825 --> 00:46:00.985
of our brand strategy.

819
00:46:02.355 --> 00:46:05.425
Again, we are gonna, uh, reserve one lecture

820
00:46:05.925 --> 00:46:08.625
to the communication strategy and plan and talk about it.

821
00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:13.755
So I, if you're a small company

822
00:46:13.785 --> 00:46:15.875
with limited resources, what do you do?

823
00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:17.555
I get this question a lot.

824
00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:21.475
So what do I do if you are a B2B versus B2C?

825
00:46:21.825 --> 00:46:26.115
It's true that, um, most of my examples, um,

826
00:46:26.745 --> 00:46:28.355
will be from the B2C world.

827
00:46:28.975 --> 00:46:33.675
Why? Because B two Cs, like the Unilevers and the p

828
00:46:33.675 --> 00:46:34.915
and gs and the Coca-Colas

829
00:46:34.915 --> 00:46:38.235
of this world have been perfecting brand management

830
00:46:38.235 --> 00:46:41.675
and marketing techniques for decades, for a hundred years.

831
00:46:42.335 --> 00:46:45.675
So it doesn't matter whether you're a B2B

832
00:46:45.735 --> 00:46:49.155
or as you are a small company, you have a lot to learn.

833
00:46:49.375 --> 00:46:53.315
We have a lot to learn from the real marketing schools

834
00:46:53.575 --> 00:46:56.355
of thought, and they are these guys.

835
00:46:56.935 --> 00:47:00.315
So even if you're a small company with limited resources,

836
00:47:00.935 --> 00:47:03.155
um, like I mentioned

837
00:47:03.155 --> 00:47:07.275
before, I think it's imperative that as, as a founder owner,

838
00:47:07.975 --> 00:47:12.515
you know, as a leader, director of the small company,

839
00:47:12.945 --> 00:47:14.835
it's important that you develop your skills.

840
00:47:14.835 --> 00:47:18.035
Because when a marketeer sits next to me,

841
00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:20.355
you should be in a position to guide them

842
00:47:20.935 --> 00:47:23.835
to have super intelligent conversations with them.

843
00:47:24.535 --> 00:47:28.235
Um, again, I'm in this group of people, you know,

844
00:47:28.285 --> 00:47:31.085
small business owners, mid, mid-sized business owners,

845
00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:36.095
and sometimes I observe conversations amongst them.

846
00:47:36.245 --> 00:47:39.415
Like, you know, someone is saying, I need a marketeer.

847
00:47:40.395 --> 00:47:42.415
Can you guys, you know, recommend me? Anyone?

848
00:47:42.415 --> 00:47:45.215
Do you know anyone? Which I find a little

849
00:47:47.175 --> 00:47:50.385
troublesome because marketing in these days is

850
00:47:50.405 --> 00:47:53.465
so complicated with so many different roles.

851
00:47:54.285 --> 00:47:57.625
You know, hiring one person, you know, giving that person

852
00:47:58.325 --> 00:48:01.585
the generic, um, title of a marketeer

853
00:48:01.725 --> 00:48:05.565
and expecting that person to do a lot,

854
00:48:06.545 --> 00:48:09.405
all marketing is unrealistic.

855
00:48:10.705 --> 00:48:12.045
That's why I believe,

856
00:48:12.045 --> 00:48:15.205
especially if you're a small company owner, it's imperative

857
00:48:15.315 --> 00:48:17.365
that develop you, develop your marketing skills

858
00:48:17.465 --> 00:48:19.365
and understand what marketing is all about.

859
00:48:20.105 --> 00:48:24.485
And also then determine how to allocate specific, know-how

860
00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:27.405
among your different employees, um,

861
00:48:28.985 --> 00:48:30.245
and collaborate with them.

862
00:48:31.455 --> 00:48:33.515
And then how to use the third parties in

863
00:48:33.515 --> 00:48:34.555
an intelligent fashion.

864
00:48:36.335 --> 00:48:38.115
So marketing is a systems thinking.

865
00:48:38.505 --> 00:48:39.675
It's the science and art.

866
00:48:40.495 --> 00:48:43.595
Uh, it's data based, okay?

867
00:48:43.865 --> 00:48:45.675
Nothing happens without data.

868
00:48:46.455 --> 00:48:48.755
Um, when I consult,

869
00:48:48.815 --> 00:48:51.555
the first thing I ask is, where is data?

870
00:48:51.725 --> 00:48:56.115
Where is your data? And I am sometimes surprised to find

871
00:48:56.185 --> 00:48:59.675
that critical KPIs are ignored

872
00:48:59.735 --> 00:49:03.715
or not measured as they should, um,

873
00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:10.115
in organizations, which is a foundational, uh,

874
00:49:10.115 --> 00:49:12.235
principles of marketing have data.

875
00:49:13.135 --> 00:49:15.235
Um, and I just wanted to emphasize,

876
00:49:15.235 --> 00:49:17.995
digital marketing is a tool, not the end game.

877
00:49:18.095 --> 00:49:21.435
So it's, you know, it's a tool like never before.

878
00:49:22.195 --> 00:49:23.555
I would've loved to have

879
00:49:23.555 --> 00:49:26.635
that tool in my hands when I was a very young brand manager

880
00:49:26.665 --> 00:49:28.035
working for Unilever.

881
00:49:28.615 --> 00:49:32.155
Um, but to be a great digital marketeer, you need

882
00:49:32.155 --> 00:49:34.315
to be a great strategist first.

883
00:49:35.255 --> 00:49:38.315
And, um, it's also true that innovation

884
00:49:39.415 --> 00:49:43.515
is absolutely critical in this century, excuse me,

885
00:49:46.405 --> 00:49:48.515
innovation and creativity.

886
00:49:49.605 --> 00:49:54.535
So being a great marketeer brand manager,

887
00:49:55.395 --> 00:49:58.975
you know, managing brands also require us in today's world

888
00:49:58.975 --> 00:50:02.735
to understand how innovation is, um,

889
00:50:03.795 --> 00:50:07.775
how innovation happens, what the processes are, how to think

890
00:50:08.485 --> 00:50:09.895
like an innovative brand.

891
00:50:10.635 --> 00:50:11.815
And, uh, one

892
00:50:11.815 --> 00:50:14.095
of our lecturers is gonna be dedicated to innovation.

893
00:50:15.115 --> 00:50:16.815
So innovation plus brand

894
00:50:16.815 --> 00:50:20.175
and business, um, our critical terminologies.

895
00:50:20.955 --> 00:50:25.505
Um, we need to be asking ourselves these questions.

896
00:50:25.965 --> 00:50:29.045
How can my brand capture strategic opportunities for growth?

897
00:50:29.665 --> 00:50:32.885
How will I grow organically and or with innovation?

898
00:50:32.955 --> 00:50:35.085
Organic growth means, you know,

899
00:50:35.085 --> 00:50:36.445
with the current brands I have,

900
00:50:36.505 --> 00:50:38.525
the current business model I have,

901
00:50:38.665 --> 00:50:40.085
how can I grow organically

902
00:50:40.505 --> 00:50:43.325
and how can I add innovation to that organic growth?

903
00:50:43.985 --> 00:50:47.085
Um, what's the role of innovation in my brand's identity?

904
00:50:47.945 --> 00:50:50.205
And what type of innovation is most required

905
00:50:50.305 --> 00:50:51.485
for my business growth?

906
00:50:51.545 --> 00:50:53.325
You know, those are critical questions

907
00:50:53.345 --> 00:50:55.325
to answer for ourselves.

908
00:50:56.585 --> 00:50:59.245
So brand development and innovation go together.

909
00:51:00.105 --> 00:51:04.125
And to be able to do that, we need to grow from the brand

910
00:51:04.665 --> 00:51:06.645
to be able to be relevant.

911
00:51:07.185 --> 00:51:11.045
And I will give you examples about what that means, um,

912
00:51:11.225 --> 00:51:13.445
during the innovation cl uh, lecture.

913
00:51:14.265 --> 00:51:18.785
So today as I'm wrapping up this lecture, I just wanted

914
00:51:18.845 --> 00:51:21.945
to introduce you to marketing, um,

915
00:51:23.845 --> 00:51:27.225
as a very critical business function.

916
00:51:28.045 --> 00:51:32.345
Um, no matter whether, you know, you're B2B,

917
00:51:32.585 --> 00:51:36.545
B2C, small business startup, solopreneur,

918
00:51:36.835 --> 00:51:40.345
large corporation, um, marketing is,

919
00:51:41.375 --> 00:51:43.315
and the traditional understanding

920
00:51:43.335 --> 00:51:47.515
of marketing is absolutely critical, um, to create brands

921
00:51:47.515 --> 00:51:50.795
that are relevant, uh, to your consumers,

922
00:51:50.975 --> 00:51:52.915
to your clients, to your customers.

923
00:51:53.695 --> 00:51:57.315
Um, so I hope we are gonna have this great month together

924
00:51:57.455 --> 00:52:00.755
and learn from each other about brand building,

925
00:52:00.765 --> 00:52:03.995
about marketing, and a little bit about innovation.

926
00:52:05.705 --> 00:52:08.515
With that dma, we can open up to the q and a.

927
00:52:10.305 --> 00:52:11.525
Yes, wonderful.

928
00:52:11.655 --> 00:52:14.525
Thank you so much for this opening of the

929
00:52:15.185 --> 00:52:16.525
module of November.

930
00:52:17.645 --> 00:52:20.605
I see, uh, questions in the chat already,

931
00:52:21.695 --> 00:52:24.515
and let's start with the first one from Rim.

932
00:52:25.295 --> 00:52:28.115
Uh, and also we have a hand up from Dr. Khor, Dr.

933
00:52:28.305 --> 00:52:32.515
Khor, uh, let's, uh, ask a question from Rim.

934
00:52:32.615 --> 00:52:37.035
Uh, I think ladies first applies in this, uh, case as well

935
00:52:37.575 --> 00:52:38.835
in the next five years.

936
00:52:39.095 --> 00:52:41.955
Uh, which developing technology do you think will most

937
00:52:41.955 --> 00:52:44.915
significantly alter marketing strategies

938
00:52:46.525 --> 00:52:47.585
In the next five years?

939
00:52:47.635 --> 00:52:48.635
Which,

940
00:52:49.545 --> 00:52:51.005
Uh, which can you repeat?

941
00:52:51.185 --> 00:52:54.165
Uh, developing technologies will, uh,

942
00:52:54.165 --> 00:52:57.005
most significantly change marketing strategies.

943
00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:01.015
Uh, I, I can't give you a perfect answer,

944
00:53:01.115 --> 00:53:04.615
but obviously ai, you know, is gonna be critical.

945
00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.735
Um, artificial intelligence,

946
00:53:06.835 --> 00:53:09.775
and already I'm using AI since one year.

947
00:53:10.435 --> 00:53:12.455
Um, and I know agencies

948
00:53:12.635 --> 00:53:14.975
and creative people are utilizing ai.

949
00:53:14.975 --> 00:53:19.495
So AI is going, going to, um, I would call a great help.

950
00:53:20.735 --> 00:53:24.605
I receive usually this question, which goes like that.

951
00:53:25.225 --> 00:53:29.285
Are you scared that AI is gonna be sort of izing our role?

952
00:53:30.025 --> 00:53:31.805
And I am absolutely not scared.

953
00:53:32.165 --> 00:53:33.645
I am actually very excited

954
00:53:34.155 --> 00:53:38.765
that AI can enhance our roles, enhance our thinking,

955
00:53:39.275 --> 00:53:44.215
improve our thinking, and, um, contribute to our thinking.

956
00:53:45.035 --> 00:53:48.915
Um, other than that, in terms of technologies,

957
00:53:49.675 --> 00:53:52.235
I can't, you know, I'm not the best person

958
00:53:52.255 --> 00:53:53.635
to answer that question really.

959
00:53:54.295 --> 00:53:58.395
Um, but in any case, I'm not a technology skeptic.

960
00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:00.715
Uh, I find that, you know,

961
00:54:01.025 --> 00:54:03.955
each emerging technology has a role to play

962
00:54:04.175 --> 00:54:09.115
and, uh, marketing, creativity, innovation, our fields, uh,

963
00:54:09.335 --> 00:54:12.795
in the brand development area that can benefit a lot from,

964
00:54:13.135 --> 00:54:14.275
you know, different technologies.

965
00:54:15.225 --> 00:54:16.795
Like I am, for instance,

966
00:54:18.095 --> 00:54:20.535
whenever I'm preparing a document, a strategy,

967
00:54:20.895 --> 00:54:24.615
a presentation, a course, whatever, you know, I get

968
00:54:25.575 --> 00:54:29.835
his opinion or her opinion, ask him question, ask him

969
00:54:29.855 --> 00:54:33.795
to rate me, you know, my content, um, ask him

970
00:54:33.795 --> 00:54:35.035
what I'm missing, you know?

971
00:54:35.175 --> 00:54:39.075
So, um, previously I worked on my own, you know,

972
00:54:39.535 --> 00:54:42.075
so it's, it's a phenomenal thing to have AI

973
00:54:42.215 --> 00:54:43.795
as a brainstorming partner.

974
00:54:45.955 --> 00:54:47.375
Yes, thank you. Of course.

975
00:54:47.835 --> 00:54:50.375
Uh, thank you for the answer. Uh, Dr.

976
00:54:50.605 --> 00:54:52.135
Khor, please unmute yourself.

977
00:54:55.095 --> 00:54:58.245
Thank you very much. I love your session was awesome.

978
00:54:58.315 --> 00:55:00.165
Like always. Thank

979
00:55:00.165 --> 00:55:00.765
You. Good

980
00:55:00.805 --> 00:55:01.805
To see you again.

981
00:55:02.595 --> 00:55:06.165
Yeah, thank you. I always become very interactive when I see

982
00:55:06.165 --> 00:55:09.285
your sessions because they're very, very, uh, informative.

983
00:55:10.065 --> 00:55:12.205
Uh, regarding two points, which I want

984
00:55:12.205 --> 00:55:13.365
to, uh, discuss with you.

985
00:55:13.425 --> 00:55:14.845
One is the B2B marketing,

986
00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:17.705
which were four small business people.

987
00:55:18.125 --> 00:55:19.425
It becomes a big challenge

988
00:55:19.425 --> 00:55:23.745
because unlike, uh, B2C, where here you have, you know,

989
00:55:23.745 --> 00:55:27.185
your set audience, so rather I feel it's more convenient

990
00:55:27.285 --> 00:55:29.865
to do a B2B, um, brand building

991
00:55:30.235 --> 00:55:34.065
where you can directly communicate with your, uh, customers

992
00:55:34.065 --> 00:55:35.825
because you have limited customers.

993
00:55:36.485 --> 00:55:40.585
And if you have target com, if communication is targeted

994
00:55:40.885 --> 00:55:43.145
to these limited customer on regular intervals,

995
00:55:43.615 --> 00:55:47.465
your brand can be built on, on the, uh, values,

996
00:55:47.575 --> 00:55:48.585
what you want to convey.

997
00:55:48.615 --> 00:55:50.785
Because this, I have experienced myself,

998
00:55:51.085 --> 00:55:52.345
so I've been the chemical company,

999
00:55:52.925 --> 00:55:56.345
and, um, I have around 250 clients.

1000
00:55:56.985 --> 00:55:59.265
So I made a group of in WhatsApp,

1001
00:55:59.265 --> 00:56:02.025
and I communicate technical information with them so

1002
00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.585
that mm-hmm, this creates a brand value for me

1003
00:56:04.925 --> 00:56:07.385
as a company which shares information

1004
00:56:07.475 --> 00:56:08.825
which will be beneficial for them.

1005
00:56:09.205 --> 00:56:11.025
So this is a way we,

1006
00:56:11.085 --> 00:56:14.745
we can still do a branding in a B2B, uh, arena.

1007
00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:16.985
That's my, from my experience,

1008
00:56:17.025 --> 00:56:18.225
I thought I just shared it with you.

1009
00:56:18.545 --> 00:56:20.345
I dunno how, how right I am,

1010
00:56:20.605 --> 00:56:23.605
but maybe I should, uh, stick to you on that. I thought.

1011
00:56:24.225 --> 00:56:26.245
No, it's wonderful that you say that actually,

1012
00:56:26.245 --> 00:56:29.285
because, um, as I said, I'm actually consulting

1013
00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:30.285
with startups right now,

1014
00:56:30.505 --> 00:56:33.765
and, uh, it's true, it's a different kind of world.

1015
00:56:33.945 --> 00:56:36.365
But, uh, when I immersed myself in their, in their,

1016
00:56:36.425 --> 00:56:39.365
you know, in, in their, in their industries, the,

1017
00:56:39.785 --> 00:56:43.205
at the very basic level, the fundamentals of marketing

1018
00:56:43.205 --> 00:56:45.125
and brand building is the same.

1019
00:56:45.785 --> 00:56:48.645
So in the B2C world, okay, Coca-Cola, right?

1020
00:56:48.665 --> 00:56:50.285
You have billions of customers.

1021
00:56:50.745 --> 00:56:54.525
But the, the message is you have, as a, as a marketeer,

1022
00:56:54.585 --> 00:56:58.405
you have distills your message to critical components.

1023
00:56:58.865 --> 00:57:02.245
You put them in your brand house, you know, what you ought

1024
00:57:02.245 --> 00:57:05.125
to say, what you shouldn't talk about, what are critical

1025
00:57:05.125 --> 00:57:06.805
to talk about what drives growth,

1026
00:57:07.465 --> 00:57:10.405
and those principles apply to B2B as well.

1027
00:57:10.585 --> 00:57:14.965
You know, I, I'm just telling my clients, we need to define

1028
00:57:14.985 --> 00:57:19.485
for you what you need to communicate in order to come across

1029
00:57:20.225 --> 00:57:22.125
as knowledgeable as, you know,

1030
00:57:22.445 --> 00:57:25.605
whatever you wanna communicate about your job, you need

1031
00:57:25.605 --> 00:57:29.085
to define that, and you need to communicate those elements

1032
00:57:29.085 --> 00:57:30.765
and components relentlessly.

1033
00:57:31.395 --> 00:57:33.885
Okay? You're not gonna go on TV because it's meaningless,

1034
00:57:34.265 --> 00:57:36.525
but you are gonna do your newsletters,

1035
00:57:36.525 --> 00:57:38.405
you're gonna be on social media,

1036
00:57:38.545 --> 00:57:41.965
you're gonna be communicating, uh, on podcasts,

1037
00:57:41.965 --> 00:57:43.525
you're gonna have webinars,

1038
00:57:43.525 --> 00:57:45.645
you're gonna have direct contacts.

1039
00:57:45.715 --> 00:57:49.165
Your client facing teams will go to the client

1040
00:57:49.345 --> 00:57:50.605
and talk about your brand.

1041
00:57:51.865 --> 00:57:54.245
You need to be consistent about your,

1042
00:57:54.275 --> 00:57:55.325
what your product does.

1043
00:57:55.425 --> 00:57:58.085
You need to be consistent about the critical

1044
00:57:58.085 --> 00:58:01.165
and key messages you wanna ke give to these people.

1045
00:58:01.825 --> 00:58:03.805
And you need to educate your teams,

1046
00:58:03.895 --> 00:58:08.245
especially your customer facing teams relentlessly so

1047
00:58:08.245 --> 00:58:10.965
that they can talk about the way you

1048
00:58:10.965 --> 00:58:12.005
want them to talk about.

1049
00:58:12.905 --> 00:58:15.245
So, um, the principle

1050
00:58:15.465 --> 00:58:17.525
of brand building is absolutely the same,

1051
00:58:17.585 --> 00:58:20.365
but the methodology is very different.

1052
00:58:20.585 --> 00:58:24.805
And so there's a lot of training, uh, that needs to happen.

1053
00:58:25.205 --> 00:58:27.845
A lot of, you know, inductions needs to happen.

1054
00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:30.525
Um, but yeah.

1055
00:58:30.525 --> 00:58:31.685
Well, thank you for bringing it up

1056
00:58:31.685 --> 00:58:34.045
because I, I, it's very, very relevant.

1057
00:58:34.705 --> 00:58:37.165
Um, and, um,

1058
00:58:37.305 --> 00:58:40.765
the same principles apply like B2C, but the tools

1059
00:58:40.825 --> 00:58:42.445
and the tactics are different, of course.

1060
00:58:45.025 --> 00:58:46.905
I, I, I have one more question to you, uh,

1061
00:58:46.955 --> 00:58:48.025
which is more technical,

1062
00:58:48.025 --> 00:58:49.305
which you'll be the right person answer.

1063
00:58:49.305 --> 00:58:52.905
So when we have brands like Nike, Puma, Aida,

1064
00:58:53.095 --> 00:58:54.745
they're targeting the same segment,

1065
00:58:55.125 --> 00:58:58.305
and all more of the products are of the same price range,

1066
00:58:58.335 --> 00:58:59.585
they're almost the same.

1067
00:58:59.805 --> 00:59:02.825
So how do they create the kind of identity for each

1068
00:59:02.825 --> 00:59:05.025
of their brands in the customer's mind?

1069
00:59:06.365 --> 00:59:07.535
Well, if you look to Nike

1070
00:59:07.635 --> 00:59:10.655
and what they do, for instance, you know, um, they, what,

1071
00:59:10.765 --> 00:59:15.095
what you need to do is you need to craft for yourself,

1072
00:59:16.325 --> 00:59:19.865
um, a proposition, a meaning, a story

1073
00:59:20.055 --> 00:59:21.485
that only you can own,

1074
00:59:21.665 --> 00:59:25.845
and you need to relentlessly, uh, build upon that.

1075
00:59:26.025 --> 00:59:27.965
You know, same thing with Coca-Cola

1076
00:59:27.985 --> 00:59:30.365
and Pepsi-Cola, you know, if you would look at it,

1077
00:59:30.385 --> 00:59:32.085
you might say, well, it's the soft drink

1078
00:59:32.085 --> 00:59:33.285
brand, so what's the difference?

1079
00:59:33.705 --> 00:59:38.685
But Coca-Cola has always, you know, built upon optimism, uh,

1080
00:59:38.745 --> 00:59:41.085
the joy and positivity

1081
00:59:41.825 --> 00:59:45.005
and, you know, uh, the global connectedness.

1082
00:59:45.465 --> 00:59:48.005
And Pepsi was trying to be more like edgy,

1083
00:59:48.005 --> 00:59:50.325
younger generation, et cetera.

1084
00:59:50.825 --> 00:59:53.165
So of course, there are, by the way,

1085
00:59:53.165 --> 00:59:54.645
taste profile difference differences,

1086
00:59:54.645 --> 00:59:57.445
significant product differences, uh,

1087
00:59:57.445 --> 00:59:59.925
in some way significant in our own terminology.

1088
01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:04.325
But Coca-Cola has relentlessly built upon their image

1089
01:00:05.105 --> 01:00:08.165
for a hundred years, and so did Pepsi Cola.

1090
01:00:08.345 --> 01:00:11.725
So you need to, you need to, as a brand, you need

1091
01:00:11.725 --> 01:00:15.845
to con have, you know this contact

1092
01:00:15.875 --> 01:00:17.085
with your consumers

1093
01:00:17.105 --> 01:00:21.445
and understand what they're looking from you, uh,

1094
01:00:21.755 --> 01:00:24.845
what works for them, um,

1095
01:00:25.995 --> 01:00:27.445
what is relevant for them

1096
01:00:27.785 --> 01:00:32.185
and what, which, what, which messages

1097
01:00:32.615 --> 01:00:35.385
that you wanna give is relevant to them.

1098
01:00:35.645 --> 01:00:40.025
And you need to really communicate it, um, relentlessly

1099
01:00:40.245 --> 01:00:43.145
and strategically, but, uh, consistently.

1100
01:00:43.645 --> 01:00:45.225
So that's how you build brands, really.

1101
01:00:45.455 --> 01:00:48.505
It's brand investment, but strategic investment really.

1102
01:00:50.425 --> 01:00:52.255
Thank you. Thank you so much. You're welcome.

1103
01:00:55.325 --> 01:00:58.575
Wonderful. Um, moving on, uh, just a moment.

1104
01:01:00.165 --> 01:01:01.465
Uh, a question from Leslie.

1105
01:01:02.365 --> 01:01:07.145
So, is brand identity manual, uh, the same as brand id,

1106
01:01:07.295 --> 01:01:10.345
including the non-negotiables of your brand?

1107
01:01:12.515 --> 01:01:15.655
Um, brand ID is what we, in a short, uh,

1108
01:01:18.545 --> 01:01:20.305
shortcut for identity, brand identity.

1109
01:01:20.335 --> 01:01:22.585
When we talk about brand identity, we talk about

1110
01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:27.755
the brand's proposition, you know, the brand,

1111
01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:31.315
uh, house elements, which is like, what is the key message?

1112
01:01:31.385 --> 01:01:34.395
What is the brand purpose? What are the brand values?

1113
01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:38.715
Um, how, you know, what does the product deliver?

1114
01:01:38.905 --> 01:01:41.195
Sort of, you know, the, um, the,

1115
01:01:41.295 --> 01:01:45.075
you are defining the fundamentals, the north star of, star

1116
01:01:45.075 --> 01:01:47.595
of the brand, and, you know,

1117
01:01:47.595 --> 01:01:50.355
you create your brand identity based

1118
01:01:50.425 --> 01:01:51.675
upon those fundamentals.

1119
01:01:52.255 --> 01:01:53.995
And the brand identity manual,

1120
01:01:54.615 --> 01:01:58.675
I'm assuming is just a manual, uh, created

1121
01:01:58.775 --> 01:02:02.155
by marketeers to be able to communicate the essence of

1122
01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:06.195
brand, uh, and what other marketeers

1123
01:02:06.535 --> 01:02:10.795
and, uh, other employees in that organization should adhere

1124
01:02:10.815 --> 01:02:15.435
to, uh, in relation to this specific brand.

1125
01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:20.325
Usually, you know, companies create, create manuals, um,

1126
01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:25.675
manifestos or, you know, statements to describe

1127
01:02:26.015 --> 01:02:29.555
to their employees what that particular brand is all about,

1128
01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:32.195
what they can do and what they cannot do.

1129
01:02:35.815 --> 01:02:38.605
Thank you. Yes. Uh, yes.

1130
01:02:38.665 --> 01:02:41.725
Uh, by the way, can I turn off your, uh, screen sharing?

1131
01:02:42.355 --> 01:02:44.845
Sure. Wonderful. Alright.

1132
01:02:45.085 --> 01:02:48.245
A question from, uh, Julia or Ju I believe.

1133
01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:52.005
Alright, so what skills must the marketer develop in the

1134
01:02:52.005 --> 01:02:53.565
coming years to be successful

1135
01:02:53.565 --> 01:02:56.205
and make real impact on company decisions?

1136
01:02:57.865 --> 01:03:02.095
Great question. Um, many.

1137
01:03:03.315 --> 01:03:08.075
Um, I think

1138
01:03:08.345 --> 01:03:12.275
empathy is one of the most critical skills

1139
01:03:12.425 --> 01:03:13.835
that a marketeer should have.

1140
01:03:14.105 --> 01:03:17.385
Empathy for other people.

1141
01:03:19.335 --> 01:03:23.355
Um, I see sometimes some marketeers, you know, becoming

1142
01:03:24.105 --> 01:03:25.435
very rational.

1143
01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:29.075
Um, and that's important

1144
01:03:29.075 --> 01:03:31.795
because marketing is a science that needs to be data driven,

1145
01:03:33.335 --> 01:03:37.795
but you also need to cultivate your empathy skills, uh,

1146
01:03:38.735 --> 01:03:40.875
you know, psychology of the consumer.

1147
01:03:41.305 --> 01:03:45.235
Sociology, the context, the marketplace, uh, the culture,

1148
01:03:45.735 --> 01:03:49.995
you know, the soft side of the business are as critical,

1149
01:03:50.735 --> 01:03:54.475
uh, to a market theory as, you know, the business,

1150
01:03:54.535 --> 01:03:55.875
the data side of the business.

1151
01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:58.795
That's why we call it art and science. Okay?

1152
01:03:58.815 --> 01:04:01.435
So empathy, um, is number one.

1153
01:04:02.815 --> 01:04:04.505
Well, data, obviously, you know,

1154
01:04:04.515 --> 01:04:08.705
being very analytical is critical, especially these days.

1155
01:04:09.325 --> 01:04:11.905
The world is becoming complex, um,

1156
01:04:13.245 --> 01:04:16.655
with multiple solutions available to you, you know,

1157
01:04:16.675 --> 01:04:19.695
the meaning of omnichannel, um,

1158
01:04:20.975 --> 01:04:25.135
customer relationship, marketing, um, innovation, focus,

1159
01:04:25.275 --> 01:04:29.335
you know, very sort of much complex, much more complex than,

1160
01:04:29.955 --> 01:04:33.645
um, when I started out as a young brand manager.

1161
01:04:33.905 --> 01:04:37.405
So developing analytical skills are gonna be critical.

1162
01:04:37.705 --> 01:04:41.325
Um, it's a never ending story, really,

1163
01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:45.245
and I'm gonna tell you something come unconventional,

1164
01:04:45.255 --> 01:04:49.985
maybe I find that we need to also invest into

1165
01:04:50.685 --> 01:04:52.825
who we are as a person.

1166
01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:56.705
You know, we all have different strengths and weaknesses

1167
01:04:57.125 --> 01:05:00.825
and, um, as much as you know, we can lump sum

1168
01:05:00.825 --> 01:05:02.665
what is required under certain,

1169
01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:06.265
certain themes like amp empathy, like, you know, analytical.

1170
01:05:07.205 --> 01:05:11.865
We need to also cultivate our own proprietary strengths.

1171
01:05:12.565 --> 01:05:14.425
If you are great at design,

1172
01:05:15.425 --> 01:05:17.765
if you're interested in design work on it.

1173
01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:21.925
Because if you work on it, um, you find

1174
01:05:21.955 --> 01:05:25.965
that you are also working on the other skills

1175
01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:29.285
that are required to be a great marketeer.

1176
01:05:29.305 --> 01:05:32.885
Let me give you an example from myself, you know, um,

1177
01:05:33.775 --> 01:05:35.325
while I was living in Atlanta

1178
01:05:35.745 --> 01:05:37.085
and, uh, still working

1179
01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:39.685
for the Coca-Cola company towards the end of it.

1180
01:05:40.225 --> 01:05:42.645
So I was getting a little lacy

1181
01:05:42.645 --> 01:05:45.525
and I was thinking maybe I should start doing my own thing.

1182
01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:48.485
Maybe I should, you know, um, set up my own company,

1183
01:05:48.575 --> 01:05:49.925
maybe I should go back home,

1184
01:05:50.365 --> 01:05:51.445
whatever, you know, all those questions.

1185
01:05:51.445 --> 01:05:53.365
So I was questioning a lot of things in my mind,

1186
01:05:54.265 --> 01:05:57.645
and I have always loved interior design, so I was like,

1187
01:05:57.905 --> 01:06:00.005
one day I'm gonna do something about it.

1188
01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:03.245
And at one of those points in my life,

1189
01:06:03.265 --> 01:06:06.005
in the corporate world, while I was questioning a lot

1190
01:06:06.005 --> 01:06:07.805
of things, I needed some invigoration.

1191
01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:11.085
So I researched and come across to this master

1192
01:06:11.145 --> 01:06:13.805
of arts program at Scat Saana College of Art

1193
01:06:13.805 --> 01:06:16.045
and Design, which is a great college in us,

1194
01:06:16.945 --> 01:06:21.125
and they offered an online MA program for interior design,

1195
01:06:21.155 --> 01:06:22.205
just pure theoretical.

1196
01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.965
I applied, had to write a paper, got accepted,

1197
01:06:26.345 --> 01:06:29.485
and for the next two years I did masters in a,

1198
01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.085
in interior design, completely unrelated

1199
01:06:32.145 --> 01:06:34.485
to my marketing and innovation career.

1200
01:06:34.765 --> 01:06:39.335
I just did it for fun because I loved design ever.

1201
01:06:40.015 --> 01:06:43.295
I was a little kid. Anyway, I did that program,

1202
01:06:43.575 --> 01:06:44.735
I finished with 4.0.

1203
01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:49.495
I'm very proud of it. And you know what I figured out that,

1204
01:06:49.835 --> 01:06:53.655
um, you know, marketing is about understanding human need,

1205
01:06:54.195 --> 01:06:56.615
so is design, so is interior design.

1206
01:06:56.915 --> 01:07:00.135
So those two years that I cultivated, that I started

1207
01:07:00.235 --> 01:07:05.055
as a hobby, actually cultivated my understanding of people,

1208
01:07:05.795 --> 01:07:08.455
my appreciation of marketing and building brands.

1209
01:07:09.195 --> 01:07:11.895
So we, in today's modern world,

1210
01:07:12.435 --> 01:07:15.255
we put our own interests, hobbies,

1211
01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:17.175
et cetera, at the back burner.

1212
01:07:17.675 --> 01:07:20.535
And we think that, um, interests that don't,

1213
01:07:20.535 --> 01:07:23.575
that don't make us money are not important,

1214
01:07:23.835 --> 01:07:27.495
but they are as important to cultivate our skills

1215
01:07:27.755 --> 01:07:29.455
as marketeers as anything else.

1216
01:07:29.715 --> 01:07:31.575
So that's a side note from me.

1217
01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:36.735
Work on your, um, own skills

1218
01:07:37.765 --> 01:07:38.935
that no one else has.

1219
01:07:39.075 --> 01:07:41.055
You know, you never know where they get you,

1220
01:07:41.665 --> 01:07:44.135
especially in marketing, that's a very important sort

1221
01:07:44.135 --> 01:07:47.625
of thing, I find. Yes, Dima,

1222
01:07:48.285 --> 01:07:49.385
What's a great answer.

1223
01:07:49.555 --> 01:07:52.665
Thank you. Alright, so moving on.

1224
01:07:52.745 --> 01:07:54.105
A question from, uh, Herbert.

1225
01:07:54.485 --> 01:07:58.545
Uh, considering how integral digital marketing is

1226
01:07:58.565 --> 01:08:01.665
to build real-time connections, gathering insights

1227
01:08:01.665 --> 01:08:05.865
and shaping brand stories, wouldn't calling it just a tool

1228
01:08:06.465 --> 01:08:09.305
overlook the death depth of its role

1229
01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:13.265
and, uh, potential in, uh, modern marketing strategies?

1230
01:08:14.315 --> 01:08:15.325
You're absolutely right.

1231
01:08:15.405 --> 01:08:18.125
I mean, digital marketing is so crucial in today's world.

1232
01:08:18.325 --> 01:08:21.405
I call it a tool deliberately to make a point

1233
01:08:21.405 --> 01:08:24.125
because, um, most of the time people think

1234
01:08:24.125 --> 01:08:26.805
of digital marketing as the end game.

1235
01:08:27.925 --> 01:08:30.405
I think digital marketing is not an end game.

1236
01:08:31.365 --> 01:08:34.805
Strategic thinking should be at the forefront at every

1237
01:08:34.865 --> 01:08:35.965
of everything you're doing.

1238
01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:39.405
I've seen so many times that digital marketing is just used

1239
01:08:39.745 --> 01:08:44.165
as a sort of fast, let's try this kind of gimmick, uh,

1240
01:08:45.015 --> 01:08:46.565
which I think is completely wrong.

1241
01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:48.645
That's why I wanted to sort of under, uh,

1242
01:08:49.145 --> 01:08:51.085
and I was expecting such a question

1243
01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:55.125
because yes, digital marketing is an amazing, um,

1244
01:08:56.405 --> 01:08:59.005
strategic tool, uh, to talk about your brand,

1245
01:08:59.005 --> 01:09:00.245
to establish your brand.

1246
01:09:00.825 --> 01:09:04.405
Um, but nevertheless, the strategic thinking, the foundation

1247
01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:08.845
principles of what your brand stands for in the eye

1248
01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:10.965
of the consumer, what message you should be

1249
01:09:10.965 --> 01:09:12.885
giving needs to come first.

1250
01:09:13.185 --> 01:09:16.245
And I have seen many times that this is omitted

1251
01:09:16.595 --> 01:09:18.965
because of the speed in today's world,

1252
01:09:18.965 --> 01:09:20.565
because of everything is so fast

1253
01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.605
and digital marketing can be so fast

1254
01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:25.325
and people omit, uh,

1255
01:09:25.325 --> 01:09:27.565
the foundational principles of marketing.

1256
01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:30.405
So I just wanna highlight that

1257
01:09:31.065 --> 01:09:34.485
and, uh, you know, nudge a little bit that point really.

1258
01:09:34.665 --> 01:09:38.085
But thank you for, um, raising it. Uh, I appreciate it.

1259
01:09:40.455 --> 01:09:43.465
Okay, thank you. Uh, question from, uh, Deborah.

1260
01:09:44.245 --> 01:09:48.745
Uh, so, uh, I'll read it from, uh, the first, uh, person.

1261
01:09:49.825 --> 01:09:51.265
I am a solopreneur.

1262
01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:55.665
I operate a micro business using my textile artist skills in

1263
01:09:55.705 --> 01:09:57.585
a market that focuses on tourism.

1264
01:09:58.375 --> 01:10:00.505
Will you give an example of a brand strategy

1265
01:10:00.725 --> 01:10:03.265
or a marketing strategy or micro businesses,

1266
01:10:05.765 --> 01:10:07.105
Uh, right now?

1267
01:10:08.535 --> 01:10:13.345
Well, um, the principle

1268
01:10:13.525 --> 01:10:14.825
is this,

1269
01:10:17.075 --> 01:10:20.095
and we are gonna talk about it in the next sessions,

1270
01:10:20.235 --> 01:10:22.655
but for now, let me underline this.

1271
01:10:23.565 --> 01:10:26.985
What is the principle of brand building one,

1272
01:10:28.235 --> 01:10:29.255
define your market.

1273
01:10:30.725 --> 01:10:33.775
What does that mean? Defining your market means

1274
01:10:34.875 --> 01:10:36.095
who is my target audience?

1275
01:10:38.505 --> 01:10:41.485
In what kind of framework do I operate?

1276
01:10:41.835 --> 01:10:45.575
What is my competi competitive? Who are my competitive set?

1277
01:10:46.355 --> 01:10:48.615
Um, where do I sell my product?

1278
01:10:50.175 --> 01:10:53.335
W how is my market segmented?

1279
01:10:53.485 --> 01:10:55.175
What price point do I have?

1280
01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:58.535
What price point should I have?

1281
01:10:59.515 --> 01:11:02.995
Um, why am I selling this product?

1282
01:11:04.335 --> 01:11:07.825
What is the need if I think she said tourism, right?

1283
01:11:08.445 --> 01:11:10.465
So, you know, if it's about tourism

1284
01:11:10.885 --> 01:11:13.365
or it's traveling, I, I'm sorry, I forgot that.

1285
01:11:13.985 --> 01:11:17.645
Um, why would people need that product?

1286
01:11:18.585 --> 01:11:22.155
So you need to ask yourself a lot of questions.

1287
01:11:22.295 --> 01:11:25.555
We will talk about, and the same principles, right?

1288
01:11:26.275 --> 01:11:28.035
Actually, you need to understand your market,

1289
01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:29.755
the foundation of your market.

1290
01:11:30.015 --> 01:11:32.275
You need to understand your target audience,

1291
01:11:32.305 --> 01:11:33.515
what they need from you.

1292
01:11:34.255 --> 01:11:36.235
And then within that framework,

1293
01:11:37.025 --> 01:11:38.835
also understanding your competition.

1294
01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:42.395
Then you need to look at yourself at the mirror

1295
01:11:42.935 --> 01:11:44.955
and define for yourself

1296
01:11:45.265 --> 01:11:47.355
what makes you different in that marketplace.

1297
01:11:47.935 --> 01:11:50.195
You should be able to answer this question.

1298
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.915
Um, why should people prefer me?

1299
01:11:54.735 --> 01:11:56.595
Why should people buy from me?

1300
01:11:57.585 --> 01:12:00.475
What am I serving them that others cannot?

1301
01:12:02.225 --> 01:12:05.925
Or if I've, if I'm serving something similar that others do,

1302
01:12:06.585 --> 01:12:08.205
why should they buy from me?

1303
01:12:09.265 --> 01:12:11.685
You know, only by answering these questions,

1304
01:12:12.315 --> 01:12:15.485
then you could be in a position to say, okay,

1305
01:12:16.155 --> 01:12:18.605
this is my difference in the marketplace.

1306
01:12:19.355 --> 01:12:22.125
This is how I'm gonna be relevant to my

1307
01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:24.125
customers, to the users.

1308
01:12:25.025 --> 01:12:28.845
So this is how I need to talk to them to be able

1309
01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:32.125
to be relevant and, you know, meaningful to my users.

1310
01:12:32.345 --> 01:12:35.015
So the essence

1311
01:12:35.315 --> 01:12:37.855
of brand building really is not different.

1312
01:12:38.115 --> 01:12:39.615
You know, the, the questions

1313
01:12:39.615 --> 01:12:43.855
that a million dollar brand asks itself, uh,

1314
01:12:43.855 --> 01:12:47.695
is not different than me trying to be relevant to you

1315
01:12:48.315 --> 01:12:50.975
or you trying to be relevant to your consumers.

1316
01:12:50.975 --> 01:12:54.215
So we are going to have sessions about the marketing

1317
01:12:54.215 --> 01:12:56.335
thinking in the next, you know, in the,

1318
01:12:56.355 --> 01:12:57.535
in the next lectures.

1319
01:12:58.155 --> 01:13:00.535
And I will try to remember your question

1320
01:13:00.595 --> 01:13:01.695
and reference that too.

1321
01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:04.135
But I hope you will benefit from all those

1322
01:13:04.175 --> 01:13:06.355
lectures this month.

1323
01:13:07.445 --> 01:13:08.445
Thank you.

1324
01:13:09.575 --> 01:13:12.975
Thank you. Alright, um, moving on.

1325
01:13:13.975 --> 01:13:17.235
Yes, so we have a lot of time actually. Alright.

1326
01:13:17.415 --> 01:13:19.395
So, uh, from, uh, Dr.

1327
01:13:19.665 --> 01:13:22.955
Anem, uh, with skepticism towards, uh,

1328
01:13:22.955 --> 01:13:26.755
traditional advertising role, why is it crucial for brands

1329
01:13:26.815 --> 01:13:30.435
to shift their marketing strategies towards authenticity

1330
01:13:31.055 --> 01:13:32.595
and value driven content?

1331
01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.475
And how can they effectively achieve this?

1332
01:13:37.155 --> 01:13:39.575
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.

1333
01:13:39.705 --> 01:13:40.895
Skepticism about what?

1334
01:13:41.805 --> 01:13:43.345
Uh, traditional advertising,

1335
01:13:43.975 --> 01:13:44.975
Okay. Why should

1336
01:13:44.975 --> 01:13:46.345
brands be authentic?

1337
01:13:47.805 --> 01:13:51.465
Uh, yes. And, uh, why should they, um,

1338
01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.485
focus on, uh, value driven content

1339
01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.605
and how to effectively achieve?

1340
01:13:58.605 --> 01:13:59.605
Well, you need to be authentic.

1341
01:13:59.825 --> 01:14:04.805
If you wanna have presence in your market,

1342
01:14:05.225 --> 01:14:07.005
you know, how else can you be relevant?

1343
01:14:07.545 --> 01:14:09.085
You know, authenticity is about,

1344
01:14:09.295 --> 01:14:11.165
think about brands like a person.

1345
01:14:11.705 --> 01:14:15.365
You know, me, you, we all need

1346
01:14:15.365 --> 01:14:17.165
to be authentic in our own context.

1347
01:14:17.385 --> 01:14:20.565
You know, authentic means authenticity means being true

1348
01:14:20.565 --> 01:14:23.245
to yourself, to your strengths, to your weaknesses.

1349
01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:27.525
Nobody's perfect, neither brands, nor I'm not perfect.

1350
01:14:27.845 --> 01:14:29.525
I don't know everything, you know,

1351
01:14:30.025 --> 01:14:32.005
and authentic for me means to be able

1352
01:14:32.005 --> 01:14:34.085
to say sometimes I don't know this, right?

1353
01:14:34.425 --> 01:14:36.125
But I, I have a point of view here

1354
01:14:36.225 --> 01:14:37.605
and I know this really well.

1355
01:14:38.185 --> 01:14:42.125
So, authenticity is about, you know, as a brand, um,

1356
01:14:43.235 --> 01:14:45.645
knowing who you are, your strengths,

1357
01:14:45.645 --> 01:14:49.445
and playing on your strengths and being real.

1358
01:14:50.065 --> 01:14:53.645
Um, which also means, you know, if you promise something,

1359
01:14:53.705 --> 01:14:55.245
you are actually delivering it.

1360
01:14:55.915 --> 01:14:58.565
Like I said in the beginning, marketing cannot be created,

1361
01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:01.045
or brands cannot be created out of thin air.

1362
01:15:01.405 --> 01:15:04.645
Authenticity is required to be able to

1363
01:15:05.325 --> 01:15:07.245
communicate something which actually the

1364
01:15:07.245 --> 01:15:08.365
product is delivering.

1365
01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:11.845
So that's why you need authenticity. I need authenticity.

1366
01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:14.645
A brand needs authenticity. You need authenticity.

1367
01:15:15.265 --> 01:15:19.885
And value driven content is about, you know, izing

1368
01:15:20.035 --> 01:15:22.645
with your users, especially nowadays in the

1369
01:15:22.645 --> 01:15:23.685
social media context.

1370
01:15:24.025 --> 01:15:27.525
Um, that's brought, you know, talked about a lot, you know,

1371
01:15:27.905 --> 01:15:30.845
how can I add value to my followers?

1372
01:15:31.465 --> 01:15:34.725
Um, meaning, you know, empathizing with their needs,

1373
01:15:35.185 --> 01:15:37.965
you know, understanding where they're coming from, um,

1374
01:15:38.725 --> 01:15:41.085
thinking before they do what they would need,

1375
01:15:41.665 --> 01:15:44.965
and being able to create meaning for them

1376
01:15:45.615 --> 01:15:50.245
while also preserving my right, um, to create business

1377
01:15:50.305 --> 01:15:53.445
for myself and to make money for myself and generate revenue

1378
01:15:53.585 --> 01:15:54.645
and profit for myself.

1379
01:15:55.025 --> 01:15:56.405
So it's a balancing act,

1380
01:15:56.465 --> 01:16:01.085
but authenticity has always been at the core of really true,

1381
01:16:01.495 --> 01:16:04.565
meaningful, strong marketing and brand building.

1382
01:16:05.355 --> 01:16:07.005
It's important for everyone.

1383
01:16:11.005 --> 01:16:12.005
Okay.

1384
01:16:12.375 --> 01:16:13.725
Great answer. Thank you.

1385
01:16:14.345 --> 01:16:18.165
Uh, question from my, uh, I like it. Okay.

1386
01:16:18.585 --> 01:16:21.085
Uh, can you please explain more about the relation

1387
01:16:21.085 --> 01:16:23.845
of business strategy and marketing strategy?

1388
01:16:24.255 --> 01:16:25.485
Which one comes first?

1389
01:16:28.255 --> 01:16:29.865
It's a great question. Depends.

1390
01:16:30.065 --> 01:16:34.235
I think, well technically, um,

1391
01:16:35.145 --> 01:16:36.595
somehow they're integrated.

1392
01:16:37.075 --> 01:16:40.645
I think, you know, I don't, when I work, I mean, I

1393
01:16:41.205 --> 01:16:44.365
frequently work really with big business brands, uh,

1394
01:16:44.365 --> 01:16:47.645
with big brands, but even with small brands, you know,

1395
01:16:49.285 --> 01:16:51.885
I don't differentiate between a marketing strategy

1396
01:16:52.065 --> 01:16:53.125
and business strategy.

1397
01:16:53.345 --> 01:16:57.285
You know, um, recently a client just, you know,

1398
01:16:57.365 --> 01:17:00.605
I was just asking them, okay, where do you want me to focus?

1399
01:17:00.625 --> 01:17:01.965
And they said, we don't need you

1400
01:17:01.965 --> 01:17:03.365
to focus on growth strategy.

1401
01:17:03.465 --> 01:17:04.925
You know, you can focus on marketing,

1402
01:17:05.345 --> 01:17:07.245
and I'm thinking like, this isn't gonna work,

1403
01:17:07.245 --> 01:17:10.365
because in order to focus on marketing, you need to know

1404
01:17:10.945 --> 01:17:13.605
how this brand can grow, right?

1405
01:17:13.945 --> 01:17:17.365
How else am I gonna create a marketing strategy without

1406
01:17:17.365 --> 01:17:19.565
knowing what are the critical pillars of growth?

1407
01:17:20.465 --> 01:17:23.885
Um, and so growth strategy is a business strategy, you know,

1408
01:17:24.025 --> 01:17:27.765
but also it's the foundation of your marketing strategy.

1409
01:17:27.945 --> 01:17:30.765
So I personally do not differentiate

1410
01:17:30.995 --> 01:17:33.605
between a business strategy and marketing strategy,

1411
01:17:33.605 --> 01:17:36.605
because to me, marketing is the business itself.

1412
01:17:36.825 --> 01:17:40.125
You know, without knowing the foundations of how

1413
01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:42.685
to conduct business, how to grow in a certain market,

1414
01:17:43.265 --> 01:17:45.805
you cannot create, um, a brand.

1415
01:17:46.425 --> 01:17:50.685
Um, so everything I'm gonna be talking about in, in my case,

1416
01:17:50.785 --> 01:17:52.885
is actually into, they're interlinked.

1417
01:17:53.065 --> 01:17:55.525
The business thinking and the marketing thinking, to me,

1418
01:17:55.525 --> 01:17:57.845
they're one and the same, uh, really.

1419
01:17:58.145 --> 01:18:01.785
Um, and you know, in the companies that I worked for,

1420
01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:03.945
you know, the really billion dollar brands,

1421
01:18:04.055 --> 01:18:05.825
they think very similarly.

1422
01:18:06.045 --> 01:18:09.225
You know, um, the,

1423
01:18:09.335 --> 01:18:12.025
even they call themselves sometimes, some people, you know,

1424
01:18:12.325 --> 01:18:14.865
we are the brand general managers, you know,

1425
01:18:14.865 --> 01:18:17.225
you are the general manager of that brand, really.

1426
01:18:17.525 --> 01:18:18.985
You're not just the marketeer.

1427
01:18:18.985 --> 01:18:22.705
You need to think holistically for all, uh, for all sides

1428
01:18:22.705 --> 01:18:24.385
of your business, for your brand.

1429
01:18:25.245 --> 01:18:28.335
So to me, they are interlinked.

1430
01:18:29.935 --> 01:18:32.035
But you need to think the business fundamentals

1431
01:18:33.155 --> 01:18:36.535
to then layer upon it, the marketing details, I would say.

1432
01:18:38.525 --> 01:18:42.345
Okay. Uh, in the nature of, uh,

1433
01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:44.385
digital channels

1434
01:18:44.465 --> 01:18:47.145
and consumer expectations, being cons, uh,

1435
01:18:47.145 --> 01:18:48.185
constantly evolving.

1436
01:18:48.885 --> 01:18:52.145
Uh, do you believe investing in marketing is more essential

1437
01:18:52.245 --> 01:18:55.305
now than ever for businesses of all sizes?

1438
01:18:57.345 --> 01:18:59.245
Yes, and it has always been essential,

1439
01:18:59.425 --> 01:19:02.845
but I think, uh, it's more complicated nowadays.

1440
01:19:02.985 --> 01:19:04.845
You know? So everything is more complicated.

1441
01:19:05.175 --> 01:19:07.165
There are much more opportunities.

1442
01:19:07.315 --> 01:19:11.775
Like, you know, this, this, one of the participants asked,

1443
01:19:12.035 --> 01:19:14.215
you know, stated the importance of digital marketing.

1444
01:19:14.275 --> 01:19:17.695
Yes, absolutely. But it's more complex too, you know, um,

1445
01:19:17.695 --> 01:19:22.685
with complexity comes, um, the relevance.

1446
01:19:22.865 --> 01:19:26.725
But marketing has always been extremely important.

1447
01:19:27.265 --> 01:19:31.695
You know, I was a 25-year-old, fresh, MBA

1448
01:19:32.215 --> 01:19:33.815
interviewing for Unilever.

1449
01:19:34.355 --> 01:19:37.095
Um, I've gone through seven interviews,

1450
01:19:37.115 --> 01:19:38.895
and the seventh one was with the CEO.

1451
01:19:39.125 --> 01:19:42.415
Then of the company he interviewed, the CEOs,

1452
01:19:42.415 --> 01:19:43.735
interviewed personally, each

1453
01:19:43.755 --> 01:19:46.615
and every junior, even a junior person, okay?

1454
01:19:47.235 --> 01:19:50.735
So this CEO at the time, you know, nowadays,

1455
01:19:50.875 --> 01:19:52.055
no one is allowed to say that,

1456
01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:54.615
but you know, I'm just saying how they think the,

1457
01:19:54.615 --> 01:19:58.595
those companies, he said to me, well, he said, our people,

1458
01:19:58.775 --> 01:20:00.915
you know, our employees are important to, to us,

1459
01:20:02.295 --> 01:20:05.995
but our brands are the most important thing in our lives.

1460
01:20:06.095 --> 01:20:08.765
Our brands are more important than anything else. Okay?

1461
01:20:09.225 --> 01:20:11.765
So again, you know, nowadays, no one can say that, you know,

1462
01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:12.845
people are very important

1463
01:20:12.905 --> 01:20:15.125
and the employees are very important, et cetera.

1464
01:20:15.625 --> 01:20:19.945
But brands are the backbone of any business.

1465
01:20:20.165 --> 01:20:24.105
And what makes brands, brands is marketing as a function.

1466
01:20:24.365 --> 01:20:26.785
So marketing has always been absolutely crucial.

1467
01:20:27.085 --> 01:20:30.625
And in today's complicated, complex world, world,

1468
01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:32.945
it's still very crucial.

1469
01:20:37.025 --> 01:20:38.515
Okay. Yes. Uh,

1470
01:20:38.995 --> 01:20:42.075
a long question from Walter, uh, from Brazil.

1471
01:20:42.815 --> 01:20:47.635
Uh, besides the use of marketing pro professionals to build

1472
01:20:47.655 --> 01:20:50.355
and communicate the messages of the company, uh,

1473
01:20:50.375 --> 01:20:53.315
to the customers or to the market, uh,

1474
01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:58.075
how could we use these professionals to help modeling the,

1475
01:20:58.255 --> 01:20:59.555
uh, organizational culture

1476
01:20:59.735 --> 01:21:03.995
and the leadership mindsets in order to align, uh,

1477
01:21:04.135 --> 01:21:06.555
the mindsets both internal and external?

1478
01:21:07.355 --> 01:21:08.635
I think that's a great question,

1479
01:21:10.715 --> 01:21:15.395
and, um, it's an important

1480
01:21:15.535 --> 01:21:18.115
one because indeed, sometimes

1481
01:21:19.915 --> 01:21:24.135
for whatever reason, the company culture, um,

1482
01:21:25.745 --> 01:21:28.165
you know, there's a gap between the leadership

1483
01:21:28.585 --> 01:21:31.405
and what marketing wants to do, and that's never good.

1484
01:21:32.465 --> 01:21:36.405
So, someone asked me about

1485
01:21:37.265 --> 01:21:38.445
the marketing skills, right?

1486
01:21:38.445 --> 01:21:40.605
Leadership is a critical marketing skill,

1487
01:21:40.665 --> 01:21:42.325
and I missed it, missed it.

1488
01:21:42.325 --> 01:21:44.365
Mention it at the time. Let me emphasize it.

1489
01:21:44.385 --> 01:21:47.845
Now, great marketers are,

1490
01:21:49.465 --> 01:21:50.595
have to be great leaders.

1491
01:21:51.015 --> 01:21:54.495
And leaders. Their most important role is

1492
01:21:54.495 --> 01:21:55.535
to influence people.

1493
01:21:57.055 --> 01:22:00.675
Um, when I was a marketeer in Atlanta, we used to have,

1494
01:22:00.695 --> 01:22:01.995
you know, global roles, really,

1495
01:22:02.095 --> 01:22:04.235
but, uh, no one reported to us.

1496
01:22:04.245 --> 01:22:07.235
Funny enough, you know, as a global brand director,

1497
01:22:07.415 --> 01:22:09.395
no one reported to me from around the world.

1498
01:22:09.635 --> 01:22:12.165
I was solo contributor.

1499
01:22:12.745 --> 01:22:16.965
But then we had to do projects all around the world, uh,

1500
01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:20.685
working with senior marketeers from different countries.

1501
01:22:20.945 --> 01:22:22.125
So imagine this situation.

1502
01:22:22.125 --> 01:22:25.925
You're not obliged to give them directions or orders,

1503
01:22:26.545 --> 01:22:30.805
but you are required to influence them to,

1504
01:22:32.145 --> 01:22:33.805
to a consensus, to an alignment,

1505
01:22:33.985 --> 01:22:35.885
to work on a project, to, you know.

1506
01:22:36.305 --> 01:22:41.255
So leadership skills are absolutely critical for marketeers

1507
01:22:41.255 --> 01:22:44.135
to have in order to influence,

1508
01:22:45.035 --> 01:22:47.695
um, the organization.

1509
01:22:48.035 --> 01:22:51.135
And ultimately, it's about, um, clever

1510
01:22:51.235 --> 01:22:55.535
and intelligent negotiation, knowing the business inside out

1511
01:22:56.075 --> 01:22:58.935
and empathizing, remember I talked about empathizing

1512
01:22:58.935 --> 01:23:02.175
with the consumer, but as marketeers, we need

1513
01:23:02.295 --> 01:23:04.575
to also empathize with the other functions,

1514
01:23:04.575 --> 01:23:09.205
whether it's finance, whether it's hr, whether it's r and d,

1515
01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:11.845
and definitely the sales function.

1516
01:23:12.465 --> 01:23:14.405
We need to empathize with their needs,

1517
01:23:14.945 --> 01:23:18.285
and we need to be great listeners actually to listen

1518
01:23:18.385 --> 01:23:19.965
and understand where they're coming from.

1519
01:23:20.595 --> 01:23:22.085
Unfortunately, there's, there are,

1520
01:23:22.085 --> 01:23:24.005
there's too much pressure on marketers,

1521
01:23:24.025 --> 01:23:26.125
and they can be sometimes short with people,

1522
01:23:26.455 --> 01:23:27.525
which is never good.

1523
01:23:28.265 --> 01:23:31.805
So, um, marketers need to develop their leadership skills

1524
01:23:31.985 --> 01:23:35.125
to influence others and invite them in.

1525
01:23:36.005 --> 01:23:39.485
A good tactic is always, you know, working in project teams,

1526
01:23:40.385 --> 01:23:44.445
um, to collaborate, uh, on critical,

1527
01:23:45.305 --> 01:23:48.085
um, you know, projects, innovation projects, for instance.

1528
01:23:48.095 --> 01:23:52.925
There are great, um, skill building, team building projects,

1529
01:23:52.925 --> 01:23:55.445
because on an innovation project, you need to work

1530
01:23:55.445 --> 01:23:56.965
with all kinds of functions together.

1531
01:23:57.785 --> 01:24:00.525
So project management is a great approach actually,

1532
01:24:00.625 --> 01:24:01.645
to influence people.

1533
01:24:01.985 --> 01:24:06.645
Um, and of course, you know, um, as I said,

1534
01:24:06.645 --> 01:24:07.765
having empathy under

1535
01:24:07.865 --> 01:24:10.045
and understanding where these people are coming from.

1536
01:24:10.515 --> 01:24:14.445
I've heard many times also in the next MBA classes,

1537
01:24:14.665 --> 01:24:18.085
you know, um, people asking me, okay, we have issue

1538
01:24:18.085 --> 01:24:20.845
with this, you know, CEO, with the general manager.

1539
01:24:20.915 --> 01:24:22.125
What do, what do we deal with?

1540
01:24:22.225 --> 01:24:25.325
How do we, or with my boss, how do I deal with that?

1541
01:24:25.925 --> 01:24:29.445
I think the best way to deal with difficult situations is

1542
01:24:29.825 --> 01:24:31.565
to empathize, to understand

1543
01:24:31.975 --> 01:24:35.245
where these people are coming from, what their fears are.

1544
01:24:35.825 --> 01:24:40.685
We usually do not see people senior from us, as,

1545
01:24:40.705 --> 01:24:42.805
you know, having their own fears and worries

1546
01:24:42.985 --> 01:24:45.845
and, you know, uh, but they are people too.

1547
01:24:45.955 --> 01:24:47.285
They have their own issues.

1548
01:24:47.425 --> 01:24:50.605
And we need to have, we need to develop the impetus skills

1549
01:24:50.665 --> 01:24:52.645
to be able to understand where they're coming from

1550
01:24:52.645 --> 01:24:54.845
to be able to offer solutions and work with them.

1551
01:24:55.705 --> 01:24:59.205
Um, I read a book about negotiation years ago.

1552
01:24:59.265 --> 01:25:02.005
It helped me tremendously, you know, um,

1553
01:25:02.005 --> 01:25:04.885
because I understood that negotiation is

1554
01:25:05.925 --> 01:25:08.805
foremost a successful negotiation is about foremost

1555
01:25:09.235 --> 01:25:11.245
understanding what the other,

1556
01:25:11.245 --> 01:25:14.125
where the other person is coming from, to be able to listen

1557
01:25:14.185 --> 01:25:17.125
to them really carefully, uh, so

1558
01:25:17.125 --> 01:25:19.245
that you can contribute with intelligence.

1559
01:25:20.425 --> 01:25:23.595
Uh, which book? Um, I will,

1560
01:25:24.715 --> 01:25:25.915
I will try to find out.

1561
01:25:26.065 --> 01:25:28.115
It's an old book, but it was very impactful.

1562
01:25:28.355 --> 01:25:30.395
I think Harvard publisher,

1563
01:25:30.595 --> 01:25:32.075
I will see whether I still have it.

1564
01:25:35.155 --> 01:25:36.215
Uh, yes, please.

1565
01:25:36.955 --> 01:25:38.615
And I think we can, uh, wrap up

1566
01:25:38.615 --> 01:25:40.055
with the last question from Hood.

1567
01:25:40.675 --> 01:25:43.975
Uh, yes. And it's also a long one.

1568
01:25:44.515 --> 01:25:47.055
So, uh, with vast adoption of digital

1569
01:25:47.315 --> 01:25:50.295
and AI driven marketing, are there challenges

1570
01:25:50.355 --> 01:25:55.255
of maintaining consistent brand ID across, uh, touch points,

1571
01:25:55.385 --> 01:25:58.735
which may impact, uh, brand image and brand trust?

1572
01:25:59.025 --> 01:26:01.295
Since personalized messaging, automation

1573
01:26:01.315 --> 01:26:04.245
and AI generated contents are widely used,

1574
01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:08.365
what should a marketer do to address these challenges?

1575
01:26:09.285 --> 01:26:10.445
A really great question.

1576
01:26:11.235 --> 01:26:13.615
So, so we please, can you repeat it again,

1577
01:26:13.765 --> 01:26:14.935
Dima? I just wanna make sure I

1578
01:26:15.465 --> 01:26:16.535
Heard It fully. Yeah,

1579
01:26:16.965 --> 01:26:17.965
Sure. Uh,

1580
01:26:17.965 --> 01:26:20.015
with fast adoption of digital

1581
01:26:20.235 --> 01:26:23.455
and AI driven marketing, are there challenges

1582
01:26:23.515 --> 01:26:27.935
of maintaining consistent brand ID across touch points,

1583
01:26:28.595 --> 01:26:31.575
uh, which may impact brand image and brand trust?

1584
01:26:31.865 --> 01:26:34.135
Since personalized messaging, automation

1585
01:26:34.135 --> 01:26:36.935
and AI generated contents are widely used,

1586
01:26:37.885 --> 01:26:40.815
what should the market do to address at these challenges?

1587
01:26:41.515 --> 01:26:42.975
I'm gonna give you a theoretical answer

1588
01:26:42.975 --> 01:26:44.575
because I was never in that position.

1589
01:26:44.765 --> 01:26:46.735
Okay. But theoretically, you know,

1590
01:26:46.735 --> 01:26:49.015
since we are still managing AI

1591
01:26:49.035 --> 01:26:51.495
and it's not managing us, we should be in a position

1592
01:26:51.515 --> 01:26:53.135
to guide the ai.

1593
01:26:53.275 --> 01:26:55.855
If we are using it to generate content.

1594
01:26:56.335 --> 01:26:59.095
Actually, we can be very specific with AI

1595
01:26:59.155 --> 01:27:01.295
to generate content that we think

1596
01:27:01.955 --> 01:27:04.295
is the correct content and the right content.

1597
01:27:04.675 --> 01:27:07.415
So, um, everything

1598
01:27:07.415 --> 01:27:09.815
that we communicate should be under our control,

1599
01:27:10.065 --> 01:27:12.095
which doesn't mean okay.

1600
01:27:12.555 --> 01:27:16.895
Um, and because user collaboration, uh, is

1601
01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:18.975
also part of the norm

1602
01:27:19.195 --> 01:27:22.015
of good marketing these ga these days, these days.

1603
01:27:22.155 --> 01:27:24.695
So, you know, being

1604
01:27:25.565 --> 01:27:29.655
less rigid than we used to be 20 years ago is important,

1605
01:27:29.915 --> 01:27:33.575
but at the same time, we marketeers need to be able to

1606
01:27:34.185 --> 01:27:36.735
guide the communication, the messaging,

1607
01:27:36.955 --> 01:27:41.095
the story in the right way, otherwise there is no marketing.

1608
01:27:41.235 --> 01:27:44.575
Uh, so, um, there shouldn't be any, um,

1609
01:27:45.035 --> 01:27:48.095
any confusion left, uh, for the customer.

1610
01:27:48.095 --> 01:27:50.255
Really. That's a critical skill

1611
01:27:50.255 --> 01:27:52.655
that a marketeer should have, AI or not.

1612
01:27:55.945 --> 01:27:56.995
That will be my answer.

1613
01:27:59.065 --> 01:28:03.405
Great. Uh, if it's, uh, yeah,

1614
01:28:03.625 --> 01:28:05.965
proper reply, uh, that you are waiting for, uh,

1615
01:28:05.965 --> 01:28:10.285
please give us, uh, uh, I don't know, a big,

1616
01:28:10.425 --> 01:28:11.725
uh, thumb up.

1617
01:28:12.065 --> 01:28:16.005
Yes. I think we can actually wrap up with today's session.

1618
01:28:16.305 --> 01:28:18.765
If there are no more, um, questions,

1619
01:28:19.005 --> 01:28:21.085
I do not see any in the chat. Just

1620
01:28:21.285 --> 01:28:22.285
Checking as well.

1621
01:28:22.945 --> 01:28:27.765
Yes, so it was a great opening lecture for this,

1622
01:28:27.905 --> 01:28:29.645
uh, great module about marketing,

1623
01:28:30.065 --> 01:28:33.965
but not for, uh, the usual of the marketing director course.

1624
01:28:34.745 --> 01:28:37.205
So it'll be, uh, surely interesting.

1625
01:28:38.065 --> 01:28:39.405
Please, uh, yes,

1626
01:28:39.495 --> 01:28:41.645
don't miss the upcoming lectures and a left.

1627
01:28:41.645 --> 01:28:42.805
Thank you so much once again.

1628
01:28:43.255 --> 01:28:47.005
Thank you guys. See you in the next lectures. Bye-Bye.
